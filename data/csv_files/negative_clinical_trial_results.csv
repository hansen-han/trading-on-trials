Other endpoints were not formally tested per the study protocol because the primary endpoint of OS was not met. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies involving patients treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy; no new safety concerns were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. “Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive and challenging disease to treat, especially after progression on initial standard-of-care treatment,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “While we are disappointed by the outcome of this monotherapy trial, we are continuing to study KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of the disease and in combination with chemotherapy to address the unmet medical need of patients with triple negative breast cancer. We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this important study.” The KEYTRUDA breast cancer clinical development program encompasses several internal and external collaborative studies, including three ongoing registration-enabling studies in TNBC (KEYNOTE-355, KEYNOTE-242, and KEYNOTE-522). About KEYNOTE-119 KEYNOTE-119 is a Phase 3 randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02555657 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA monotherapy compared to single-agent physician’s choice chemotherapy in metastatic TNBC. The primary endpoint is OS and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall response rate, disease control rate and duration of response. The study randomized 622 patients to receive either KEYTRUDA as monotherapy (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks for up to 24 months) or physician’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine) at a ratio of 1:1. About Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) TNBC is an aggressive type of breast cancer that characteristically has a high recurrence rate within the first five years after diagnosis. While some breast cancers may test positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), TNBC tests negative for all three. As a result, TNBC does not respond to therapies targeting these markers, making it more difficult to treat. Approximately 10-20% of patients with breast cancer are diagnosed with TNBC. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,000 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis, or Hepatoxicity (in Combination with Axitinib) Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hepatotoxicity (in Combination With Axitinib) KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and AST were seen in 20% and 13% of patients, respectively. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are used in monotherapy. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including cHL, and postmarketing use. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions. In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose. Adverse Reactions In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

Both doses of natalizumab were generally well-tolerated and no new or important safety signals were observed. The results of the Phase 2b ACTION 2 study do not impact the benefit-risk profile of natalizumab in approved indications, including multiple sclerosis. “As pioneers in neuroscience, Biogen remains committed to developing treatments for people with acute neurological conditions including stroke,” said Michael Ehlers, executive vice president, Research & Development at Biogen. “While we are disappointed with the ACTION 2 study results, we have furthered our knowledge of the disease and will continue to pursue innovative approaches in this area, including BIIB093 (intravenous glibenclamide) for prevention and treatment of edema in large hemispheric infarction, one of the most severe types of stroke.” In the middle of 2018, Biogen plans to initiate a global Phase 3 study of BIIB093 in individuals with large hemispheric infarction, where brain swelling (cerebral edema) often leads to high morbidity and mortality. Detailed Phase 2b ACTION 2 study findings will be made available in a future scientific forum. About the natalizumab Phase 2 Development Program in AIS ACTION 2 was a Phase 2b multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-ranging study with a 90 day follow up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of natalizumab primarily in patients with moderate severity acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The study investigated natalizumab vs placebo in approximately 270 individuals who had a clinical diagnosis of AIS with last known normal (LKN) ≤ 24 hours prior to treatment initiation. The study evaluated a 300 mg dose and a 600 mg dose versus placebo, both either within 9 hours of LKN or between 9-24 hours after LKN. The primary objective of ACTION 2 was to assess the effects of natalizumab compared to placebo on clinical measures of independence and activities of daily living. The primary endpoint was a composite global measure of functional disability based on a score of 0 to 1 on a modified Rankin scale (mRS) and a score of ≥ 95 on the Barthel Index (BI) at Day 90. The mRS measures independence with specific tasks pre- and post-stroke. BI is a scale that consists of 10 items that measure activities of daily living and mobility. Natalizumab was previously evaluated in AIS in the Phase 2a ACTION study. In this study, although natalizumab did not significantly decrease the primary endpoint of infarct volume at Day 5, secondary and exploratory endpoints suggested natalizumab treatment improved clinical outcomes compared with placebo which warranted further evaluation.

These findings are inconsistent with previous trial results from SUSTAIN (NCT01895361), which demonstrated the superiority of crizanlizumab 5.0mg/ kg compared to placebo. It is important to note that the preliminary results do not suggest new safety concerns with crizanlizumab. The overall safety profile of crizanlizumab remains consistent with the known profile of the commercially available 5.0mg/kg dose. Since informing regulatory authorities, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has started a review of crizanlizumab to evaluate the impact of these results on its currently authorized use. Novartis is thoroughly reviewing the full data set of the STAND study.  In order to determine the appropriate next steps, Novartis is working with regulators globally, including the EMA, which requested data from STAND as part of the conditions for marketing authorization, as well as with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and trial investigators. Crizanlizumab was approved by the FDA in November 2019 for reduction in frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. In October 2020, the EMA granted conditional Marketing Authorization to prevent recurrent vaso-occlusive crises in patients aged 16 years and above, living with sickle cell disease. While further assessment of the trial data is ongoing, physicians should consider the individual benefit and risks when making therapeutic decisions regarding the use of crizanlizumab.

There were no statistically significant differences in the effects of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil between subjects with and without atrial fibrillation (AF) on cardiac function, including systolic ejection time and stroke volume, as well as ventricular volumes, heart rate, and NT-proBNP in patients. Overall, the pattern of adverse events did not appear markedly different between treatment arms, regardless of the presence of AF at baseline. Omecamtiv mecarbil , a novel investigational cardiac myosin activator, is being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics, with funding and strategic support from Servier. “Atrial fibrillation is a common comorbidity in people with heart failure; its prevalence increases with increasing heart failure severity and affects up to forty percent of those with NYHA class IV disease,” said Fady I. Malik, MD, PhD, Cytokinetics’ Executive Vice President, Research and Development. “Twenty percent of patients in COSMIC-HF had both heart failure and atrial fibrillation and we’re pleased to see that the treatment effects and safety of omecamtiv mecarbil in this key subgroup did not differ substantially from patients who did not have atrial fibrillation.” COSMIC-HF: Expansion Phase Design and Results The expansion phase of COSMIC-HF evaluated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of oral omecamtiv mecarbil in 448 patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either placebo or treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil dosed as 25 mg twice daily or 25 mg twice daily with dose escalation to 50 mg twice daily, depending on a plasma concentration of omecamtiv mecarbil after two weeks of treatment. The study met its primary pharmacokinetic objective and showed statistically significant improvements in all pre-specified secondary measures of cardiac function in the treatment group receiving pharmacokinetic-based (PK) dose titration. In analyses announced today, measures of efficacy of omecamtiv mecarbil were compared after 20 weeks of treatment for patients with and without AF, a subgroup whose enrollment was limited to approximately 20 percent of the overall study population. Between 32 patients with AF and 117 patients without AF, there were no significant differences in the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on systolic ejection time (p=.69), stroke volume (p=.38), left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (p=.90), left ventricular end-systolic dimension (p=.75), heart rate (p=.08) and NT-proBNP (p=.43). These results suggest that patients with both heart failure and AF respond similarly to treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil as patients with heart failure without AF. About Omecamtiv Mecarbil and the Phase 3 Clinical Trials Program Omecamtiv mecarbil is a novel, selective cardiac myosin activator that binds to the catalytic domain of myosin. Preclinical research has shown that cardiac myosin activators increase cardiac contractility without affecting intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption. i ,ii,iii Cardiac myosin is the cytoskeletal motor protein in the cardiac muscle cell that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into the mechanical force resulting in cardiac contraction. Omecamtiv mecarbil is being developed for the potential treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) under a collaboration between Amgen and Cytokinetics , with funding and strategic support from Servier. Omecamtiv mecarbil is the subject of a comprehensive Phase 3 clinical trials program comprised of GALACTIC-HF ( G lobal A pproach to L owering A dverse C ardiac Outcomes T hrough I mproving C ontractility in H eart F ailure), a large, Phase 3 global cardiovascular outcomes trial being conducted by Amgen in collaboration with Cytokinetics and METEORIC-HF ( M ulticenter E xercise T olerance E valuation of O mecamtiv Mecarbil R elated to I ncreased C ontractility in H eart F ailure), a Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil on exercise capacity, being conducted by Cytokinetics in collaboration with Amgen .

RELAX-AHF-2 did not meet its primary endpoints of reduction in cardiovascular death through Day 180 or reduced worsening heart failure through Day five when added to standard therapy in patients with AHF. ""We are disappointed this study did not confirm the efficacy of RLX030 in acute heart failure, especially given the urgent need for effective new treatments for this condition,"" said Vas Narasimhan, Global Head, Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. ""We will continue to further analyze the data to better understand and learn from these results as well as evaluate next steps for the overall program. Novartis would like to thank the patients, investigators, and site personnel around the world for their unwavering support of this study. We remain committed to improving and extending the lives of patients with cardiovascular disease and will continue to invest in ways to improve their outcomes."" AHF is a life-threatening medical condition requiring urgent evaluation and treatment[1], and is the leading cause of hospitalization in those aged over 65 years[2],[3]. Risk of mortality after hospitalization for AHF is high[4]-[11] with approximately one in five patients not surviving a year afterwards[2],[12]-[14]. About RELAX-AHF-2 RELAX-AHF-2 (NCT01870778) is an event-driven, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of RLX030 (serelaxin) when added to standard of care in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). The study has two primary endpoints; reduction of cardiovascular (CV) death through Day 180 and occurrence of worsening heart failure through Day five. The RELAX-AHF-2 study included 6,600 patients hospitalized for AHF and was initiated in October 2013. About acute heart failure AHF is a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment[1]. An AHF event may occur as a rapid deterioration of existing heart failure (HF), or may be the first presentation of HF. The condition is progressive and can be fatal after patients have one or repeated AHF event(s)[4]. During an AHF event, patients become severely breathless and need to be rushed to the emergency room for urgent treatment, making AHF the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 years[2],[3]. Risk of mortality after hospitalization for AHF is high[4]-[11] with approximately one in five patients not surviving a year afterwards[2],[12]-[14]. Despite significant progress in treating other heart conditions (including chronic HF) there have been no significant treatment breakthroughs that have improved mortality rates in AHF for decades. About RLX030 RLX030, a relaxin receptor agonist[15], is a recombinant form of the naturally-occurring human relaxin-2 hormone. Human relaxin-2 is present in both men and women and elevated levels in pregnant women are thought to help the body cope with the additional CV demands during pregnancy[16],[17] About the Novartis cardiovascular portfolio Entresto ® (sacubitril/valsartan) is the first and only approved medicine of its kind. Entresto has been given a Class I recommendation in United States and European Union clinical guidelines for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)[18]. Approved indications may vary depending upon the individual country. Its unique mode of action reduces the strain on the failing heart by enhancing the protective neuro-hormonal systems (e.g. natriuretic peptide system) and simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). To better understand HF Novartis has established FortiHFy, the largest global clinical program in HF across the pharmaceutical industry. FortiHFy has more than 40 active or planned clinical studies designed to extend understanding of HF as well as to generate an array of additional data on symptom reduction, efficacy, quality of life benefits and real world evidence with Entresto. In addition to CV research in HF, ACZ885 (canakinumab) is currently being investigated in patients with a previous heart attack and a high degree of vascular inflammation. The Phase III CANTOS trial is designed to determine if ACZ885 can reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack or death and is expected to read out in 2017.

(Nasdaq:XENE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today reported topline efficacy results from the double-blind, multi-center, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and systemic exposure of XEN801 for the treatment of moderate to severe facial acne. XEN801 is a topical stearoyl Co-A desaturase-1, or SCD1 inhibitor, developed for the potential treatment of moderate to severe acne. Results from this trial showed that XEN801 did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from vehicle placebo in its primary endpoint of the percent change in total (inflammatory and non-inflammatory) lesion count from baseline to week 12. The results also show that XEN801 did not demonstrate statistical significance relative to key secondary efficacy endpoints. XEN801 did demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no drug-related serious adverse events. Dr. Simon Pimstone , Xenon's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Despite the good scientific and preclinical rationale to pursue SCD1 as a novel acne target, the topline clinical results do not support this hypothesis or the continued development of XEN801. While we are disappointed that XEN801 did not demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of acne, we have a broad, diversified pipeline of small molecule ion channel modulators based on targets with high human validation that we continue to advance.” Dr. Pimstone added, “We look forward to a number of important milestone events anticipated over the coming months, including a topline data read-out from the Phase 2b clinical trial of TV-45070 in post-herpetic neuralgia being conducted by our collaborator, Teva; the submission of an IND, or IND equivalent, for XEN901, our proprietary novel Nav1.6 inhibitor for the potential treatment of epilepsy, presently expected in the fourth quarter of this year; and advancement by our collaborator, Genentech, of its Nav1.7 pain program into Phase 2 expected this year.  In addition, our goal is to continue to expand our current proprietary pipeline of novel, ion channel modulators through both our internal research efforts and our ongoing assessment of promising external product opportunities.” Conference Call Information Xenon will host a conference call and live audio webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time ( 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time ) to discuss the XEN801 Phase 2 clinical trial results.

At a pre-specified interim analysis conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, did not meet the study’s pre-specified statistical criteria for DFS compared to placebo plus adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. The study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since superiority was not reached for DFS. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing. Merck will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community. “While these results were not what we had hoped, we are focused on continuing to build on the established role of KEYTRUDA in advanced endometrial carcinoma through our approved indications, while rapidly progressing clinical research evaluating KEYTRUDA-based combinations and other investigational candidates, including antibody-drug conjugates, in endometrial and other types of gynecologic malignancies,” said Dr. Gursel Aktan, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We would like to thank all the patients, the investigators and our study collaborators for their participation in this trial.” In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in endometrial cancer. One indication, based on KEYNOTE-775/Study 309, is in combination with LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib), in collaboration with Eisai, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. The second indication, based on KEYNOTE-158, is as a single agent, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program in endometrial carcinoma, including the NRG-GY018/KEYNOTE-868 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by KEYTRUDA as a single agent for the treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. As previously announced , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) based on this study and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of June 21, 2024. The program also includes the KEYNOTE-C93 study evaluating KEYTRUDA versus chemotherapy in dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, as well as the MK-2870-005 study evaluating sacituzumab tirumotecan (sac-TMT), an investigational trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) being developed in collaboration with Kelun-Biotech, compared to a treatment of physicians’ choice in patients with endometrial carcinoma who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy. About KEYNOTE-B21/ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053 KEYNOTE-B21, also known as ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053, is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04634877 ) sponsored by Merck and conducted in collaboration with the European Network for Gynecologic Oncology Trial (ENGOT) groups and the GOG Foundation, Inc. (GOG) investigating adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, compared to adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, for the treatment of newly diagnosed, high-risk endometrial cancer after surgery with curative intent. The primary endpoints are DFS and OS, and secondary endpoints include safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 1,095 patients who were randomized to receive: KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for six cycles) plus concurrent standard of care chemotherapy (for four or six cycles), followed by KEYTRUDA (400 mg every six weeks for an additional six cycles), with or without radiotherapy, or Placebo (every three weeks for six cycles) plus concurrent standard of care chemotherapy (for four or six cycles), followed by placebo (every six weeks for an additional six cycles), with or without radiotherapy. About endometrial carcinoma Endometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus, which is known as the endometrium, and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 67,880 patients diagnosed with uterine body cancer and approximately 13,250 patient deaths from the disease in 2024. Globally, endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and the 15th most common cancer overall. Following primary treatment, patients face a risk of their cancer returning, often as distant metastasis, which is associated with poorer outcomes. About Merck’s research in breast and gynecologic cancers Merck is advancing research aimed at improving outcomes for patients affected by breast and gynecologic (ovarian, cervical and endometrial) cancers. Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program across these cancers comprised of more than 20 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 studies evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA currently has two approved indications for triple-negative breast cancer, including one for high-risk early-stage disease, and five approved indications across certain types of cervical and endometrial cancers (see indications below). Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of these cancers, as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA. About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Endometrial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA, in combination with LENVIMA, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) as determined by an FDA-approved test or not MSI-H, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism.

It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Please see Prescribing Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_pi.pdf and Medication Guide for KEYTRUDA at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_mg.pdf . About LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone.

Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA Warnings and Precautions Hypertension. In differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC. Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity. Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Among patients receiving LENVIMA with KEYTRUDA, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%). Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1,327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients.

If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%.

In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity. Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1,823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms. Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC. Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA. Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution. Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.

(Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced top-line results from the Phase 3 ADVANCE-2 trial evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Pimavanserin did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the study’s primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 ( NSA -16) total score (-11.8 vs. -11.1; p=0.4825; effect size=0.07). The safety and tolerability profile of pimavanserin was consistent with previous clinical trials, showing a low rate of adverse events. “We are disappointed the trial did not meet its primary endpoint given the significant unmet need in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia,” said Steve Davis , Acadia’s Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to analyze these data with our scientific advisors, but we do not intend to conduct any further clinical trials with pimavanserin. We want to thank the patients, their families, and the investigators for their contributions in this important study.” ADVANCE-2 was a 26-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 34 milligram pimavanserin in 454 adult patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia who had achieved control of positive symptoms with their ongoing antipsychotic treatment.​ ADVANCE-2 used the NSA -16 scale, designed to measure change on the wide range of predominant negative symptoms that patients experience, which looks at 16 different items in five subscales and covers symptoms such as blunted affect, poor socialization and lack of motivation.​ The change from baseline observed in the pimavanserin arm of ADVANCE-2 was similar to the change from baseline observed at the 34 milligram dose in ADVANCE-1 (-11.8 vs. -11.6); however, the placebo effect in ADVANCE-2 was higher than the placebo effect observed in ADVANCE-1 (-11.1 vs. -8.5). In ADVANCE-2, pimavanserin was well-tolerated with an adverse event rate of 30.4% compared with 40.3% for the placebo arm.

(Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced top-line results from a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ACP-044 for acute pain following bunionectomy surgery. The primary endpoint, a comparison of cumulative pain intensity scores over 24 hours between the ACP-044 1600 mg once daily, ACP-044 400 mg four times daily and placebo treatment arms, was not met. A trend favoring the ACP-044 400 mg once every six hours treatment group was observed on the primary endpoint, a difference of -10.5 points compared to placebo (p = 0.1683; effect size = 0.219). These numerical trends were consistently better than placebo, but not statistically significant, at 48 hours and 72 hours. “We are disappointed that the ACP-044 bunionectomy study did not meet its primary endpoint, especially given the significant need for novel, non-opioid treatment options for postsurgical pain. We will continue to analyze the totality of the data to best determine whether further development in acute pain is appropriate,” said Steve Davis , Chief Executive Officer. “We’d like to thank the study participants as well as the investigators and staff who contributed to this study.” Most adverse events were mild-to-moderate and there were no serious adverse events related to ACP-044. Fewer patients discontinued treatment in the ACP-044 arms than in the placebo group. Acadia is currently evaluating ACP-044 in an ongoing study in osteoarthritis, a model of chronic pain, which is expected to complete in the first half of 2023. About Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Bunionectomy Study The Phase 2 clinical trial design, evaluating the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug ACP-044 for the treatment of acute postoperative pain following orthopedic surgery (bunionectomy), was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 239 patients undergoing bunion removal on one foot. Patients were randomized to one of the following three groups: 1600 mg of ACP-044 administered once daily (n=78), 400 mg every six hours (n=81), or placebo (n=80). Patients were first dosed prior to surgery and continued treatment for a total of four days. Patients self-reported their pain intensity using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), which scores pain on a scale of 0-10. About ACP-044 ACP-044 is a non-opioid, novel, first in class, redox modulator investigational drug in development for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. 1 ACP-044 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with minimal brain distribution that is believed to function as a redox modulator of reactive oxygen species such as peroxynitrite. Reactive oxygen species arise from tissue injury and inflammation and are thought to intensify pain through a variety of different pathways. 2,3,4,5,6 ACP-044’s mechanism of action is believed to modulate redox pathways involved in pain signaling by reducing increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite. 1 Downstream effects of increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen species levels may result in peripheral and central nerve sensitization, cytotoxicity, inflammation, and pain. 2,3,4,7 Redox modulation represents a novel and promising approach to acute and chronic pain management. 2,3,4,5,6 About Acute Postoperative Pain Pain is a major healthcare issue, with high prevalence, significant patient burden and substantial economic impact. 8 A high unmet need remains in postoperative pain with more than 50 million surgical cases in the U.S. annually and approximately 75% of patients reporting postoperative pain as moderate, severe, or extreme. 9,10 Currently, opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the leading treatment options for acute postoperative pain. 11 Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people aged 18 to 45 years and in 2021, led to an average of 128 overdose deaths each day, per CDC estimates. As such, there is a great need for additional effective and safe treatment options as part of a multimodal treatment strategy.

KeyVibe-002 is evaluating MK-7684A, a coformulation of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT therapy, and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA ® ), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, with or without docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. KeyVibe-002, a partially blinded study, was designed with two primary objectives: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of MK-7684A alone compared with docetaxel, a standard of care; and 2) in a blinded assessment, evaluate the efficacy of adding MK-7684A to docetaxel compared with docetaxel alone. Results from the open-label arm of the study evaluating MK-7684A alone showed that the coformulation did not reach statistical significance for the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) and was numerically less effective compared with docetaxel. Merck is notifying study investigators that patients in this arm of the study should be switched to a standard of care, unless their physician considers the patient is benefitting from MK-7684A alone. The blinded arms of the study will continue to further evaluate MK-7684A with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. The safety profile of MK-7684A was consistent with that observed for vibostolimab and pembrolizumab in previously reported studies, with no new safety signals observed. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting once further data from the blinded study arms are available. Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating the safety and efficacy of MK-7684A alone and in combination with other agents in over 4,000 patients. Ongoing Phase 3 studies in lung cancer include KeyVibe-003 , KeyVibe-006 , KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008 , as well as KeyVibe-010 in melanoma. “Through different approaches, such as novel combinations and coformulations, we hope to build on the foundation of KEYTRUDA to help even more patients with cancer,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study evaluating MK-7684A in a heavily pre-treated group of patients, and look forward to additional data from the continuation of the blinded arms of KeyVibe-002. Based on responses we have seen in the signal-finding Phase 1/2 program to date, we are moving forward with our comprehensive research program evaluating MK-7684A across a wide range of cancers, including lung, other solid tumors and blood cancers.” About KeyVibe-002 KeyVibe-002 is a randomized, partially blind Phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04725188 ) evaluating MK-7684A, a coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab, with or without docetaxel versus placebo plus docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The trial’s primary endpoint is PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST) v1.1. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response (OR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1. The study enrolled 255 patients who were randomly assigned in three separate study arms (1:1:1) to receive either: Arm 1 (Open-label): MK-7684A (pembrolizumab 200 mg plus vibostolimab 200mg/20 mL intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] until a discontinuation criterion is met or completion of 35 cycles), or; Arm 2 (Blinded): MK-7684A (pembrolizumab 200 mg plus vibostolimab 200mg/20 mL IV Q3W until a discontinuation criterion is met or completion of 35 cycles) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m^2, IV Q3W until a discontinuation criterion is met or as per approved local label), or; Arm 3 (Placebo-blinded): Placebo (saline IV Q3W) plus docetaxel (75 mg/m^2, IV Q3W until a discontinuation criterion is met or as per approved local label). KeyVibe-002, a non-registrational study, was designed with two primary objectives: 1) to evaluate the efficacy of MK-7684A alone compared with docetaxel, a standard of care; and 2) in a blinded assessment, evaluate the efficacy of adding MK-7684A to docetaxel, compared with docetaxel alone. About lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021. About Merck’s research in lung cancer Merck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA. About vibostolimab Vibostolimab is a humanized anti-TIGIT therapy discovered and developed by Merck. Vibostolimab restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155), thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. MK-7684A is a coformulation of both vibostolimab and pembrolizumab and is being evaluated in a wide range of cancers, including lung, other solid tumors and blood cancers. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is: stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational, selective, small molecule cardiac myosin activator for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. METEORIC-HF evaluated the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following 20 weeks of treatment in patients with HFrEF receiving standard of care therapy. The trial completed enrollment of 276 patients in June 2021 . There was no effect on the primary endpoint, which was the change in peak oxygen uptake (pVO 2 ) on CPET from baseline to Week 20 in patients treated with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo. Adverse events, including major cardiac events, were similar between the treatment arms and the safety profile of omecamtiv mecarbil in METEORIC-HF was consistent with prior clinical trials including GALACTIC-HF. Results from METEORIC-HF will be presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 71 st Annual Scientific Session & Expo, in a Late Breaking Clinical Trial session on Sunday, April 3, 2022 from 9:45-9:55 a.m. ET . “While medical therapies have demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, as was also observed with omecamtiv mecarbil in GALACTIC-HF, demonstrating an improvement in exercise capacity with these same medical therapies has been elusive,” said Fady I. Malik , M.D., Ph.D., Cytokinetics’ Executive Vice President of Research & Development. “These neutral results from METEORIC-HF may provide new insights into the role of cardiac function in determining exercise capacity relative to other potential contributors such as skeletal muscle dysfunction. We are grateful to the trial investigators, site personnel, patients and caregivers who participated in the METEORIC-HF, especially given challenges posed by the pandemic.” Cytokinetics recently announced that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and filed the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for omecamtiv mecarbil. The NDA is supported by the results from GALACTIC-HF ( G lobal A pproach to L owering A dverse C ardiac Outcomes T hrough I mproving C ontractility in H eart F ailure), the Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil that enrolled over 8,000 patients in 35 countries across 945 sites. GALACTIC-HF demonstrated a statistically significant effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to reduce risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care. Additional analyses from GALACTIC-HF demonstrated a greater treatment effect of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as other characteristics that may indicate worsening heart failure. About Omecamtiv Mecarbil Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational, selective, small molecule cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes 1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart, binding to and recruiting more cardiac myosin heads to interact with actin during systole. Omecamtiv mecarbil is designed to increase the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently augment the impaired contractility that is associated with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Preclinical research has shown that omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption. 2-4 The development program for omecamtiv mecarbil is assessing its potential for the treatment of HFrEF. Positive results from GALACTIC-HF, the first Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil demonstrated a statistically significant effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to reduce risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care. No reduction in the secondary endpoint of time to CV death was observed. Adverse events and treatment discontinuation of study drug were balanced between treatment arms. The FDA has accepted for filing the NDA for omecamtiv mecarbil based on the results from GALACTIC-HF and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of November 30, 2022 .

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-921 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel) compared to chemotherapy alone did not meet its dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In the study, there were modest trends toward an improvement in both OS and rPFS for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. “Results from this study serve as an important reminder that metastatic prostate cancer remains very difficult to treat, and more research is needed. We will continue to advance our clinical development program to evaluate KEYTRUDA-based combinations and novel candidates for patients with this disease,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study.” Merck has a strong commitment to the development of new treatment options for people with prostate cancer. Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in prostate cancer, including the Phase 2 trials KEYNOTE-199 and KEYNOTE-365 and the Phase 3 registrational trials KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-991. Additionally, last month, Merck entered into a global development and commercialization agreement with Orion Corporation for Orion’s investigational candidate ODM-208, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. About KEYNOTE-921 KEYNOTE-921 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03834506 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel) and prednisone compared with placebo in combination with chemotherapy and prednisone for the treatment of patients with mCRPC who have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC but whose disease has progressed on or is intolerant to a next-generation hormonal agent. The trial enrolled 1,030 patients who were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately two years) plus chemotherapy and prednisone or placebo plus chemotherapy and prednisone. The dual primary endpoints are OS and rPFS. Secondary endpoints include time to initiation of the first subsequent anti-cancer therapy, prostate-specific antigen response rate, objective response rate and duration of response. About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with advanced prostate cancer will develop CRPC within five years, and at least 84% of these patients will have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients.

KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

TV-45070 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no drug-related serious adverse events. Low drug plasma levels coupled with the favorable tolerability profile support the topical application rationale and continued development in neuropathic pain. Teva and Xenon remain fully committed to the development of TV-45070 for neuropathic pain indications and await the results from the ongoing PHN Phase 2b study, expected in the second half of 2016 . JERUSALEM and BURNABY, British Columbia , July 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TEVA) (TASE:TEVA) and Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:XENE) reported today top line results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied TV-45070 (4% and 8% w/w ointment) in patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. TV-45070 is a small molecule inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7 and other sodium channels, including those that are expressed in the pain-sensing peripheral nervous system. Results from this trial showed that TV-45070 4% and 8% did not demonstrate statistically significant difference from placebo in efficacy endpoints of reductions in pain due to OA. TV-45070 did demonstrate a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with no drug-related serious adverse events. This is important given the ongoing Phase 2b study of TV-45070 in post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). The most common adverse events were application site dermal skin reactions which were mostly mild and less frequent than seen with other topical analgesics. There were no cardiac or CNS safety issues. ""The rationale for development of TV-45070 in OA has unfortunately not been confirmed with these results. However, neuropathic pain represents a distinct mechanism of chronic pain to OA and, as such, the potential for positive study results in PHN is not impacted by these data,"" said Richard Malamut M.D. Teva's Vice President and Head of Pain Therapeutic Development . ""Given the favorable safety and tolerability profile demonstrated, we remain hopeful that TV-45070 can offer a new and valuable option to patients with neuropathic pain."" ""While we are disappointed that the Phase 2b trial top-line results did not indicate efficacy in OA, Teva and Xenon have always been committed to a broad development plan for TV-45070 in both nociceptive and neuropathic pain,"" said Dr. Simon Pimstone , Xenon's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The Phase 2b trial in PHN being conducted by Teva is progressing as planned, and we look forward to seeing top-line results from that trial in the second half of 2016. In addition, Xenon will continue to focus on advancing our partnered and proprietary pipeline programs, and leveraging the potential of our Extreme Genetics platform and expertise in ion channel target discovery. We look forward to other near-term milestone opportunities across our diverse product candidate pipeline."" About TV-45070 TV-45070 (formerly XEN402) is a topically applied small-molecule inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7 and other sodium channels, including those that are expressed in the pain-sensing peripheral nervous system. Applied topically, TV-45070 acts locally to inhibit Nav1.7 in the skin and underlying tissue, mitigating systemic absorption and the potential risks of side-effects that accompany systemic drug metabolism. The pain target Nav1.7 was identified by Xenon using its Extreme Genetics discovery platform. Xenon developed TV-45070 through early clinical development and partnered with Teva through a collaborative development and license agreement established in 2012, providing Teva with an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize TV-45070. A Phase 2b trial in PHN is currently underway, with results expected in the second half of 2016. About the TV-45070 Osteoarthritis Phase 2b Trial The Phase 2b osteoarthritis trial of TV-45070 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at approximately 40 clinical sites across the US. There were three arms in the study and a total of 389 patients were randomized on a 1:1:1 basis: experimental TV-45070 4% administered twice per day; experimental TV-45070 8% administered twice per day; and placebo comparator (matched ointment without TV-45070) administered twice per day. Patients were eligible to participate in the trial if they were 40-85 years of age, had primary OA in a single knee (target knee), and met pre-specified visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and were otherwise medically healthy. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2b trial was to evaluate the efficacy of four weeks of topical administration of TV-45070 (4% and 8% ointment) compared with placebo for the relief of symptoms of primary OA of the target knee as assessed by the change from baseline to the last five days of treatment in average evening pain score upon walking on a flat surface using Question 1 of the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) on a 0-100 mm visual analog scale. The efficacy endpoints were analyzed on a full analysis set defined as all patients having received at least one dose of study drug and having at least one post baseline efficacy assessment. Key secondary objectives of the trial included changes in WOMAC pain subscale scores, responder rates, and patient-reported outcome assessments. About Teva Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

In the KEYLYNK-006 trial, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy followed by KEYTRUDA plus maintenance LYNPARZA did not meet the study’s pre-specified statistical criteria for OS or PFS compared to KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin) followed by KEYTRUDA plus maintenance chemotherapy (pemetrexed). The safety profiles of KEYTRUDA and LYNPARZA in this trial were consistent with those observed in previously reported studies for the individual therapies. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing. Merck will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community. “As lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, we are committed to exploring KEYTRUDA-based combinations and novel candidates that may further help improve patient outcomes,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. “These results are an important reminder of how challenging it may be to treat these patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. We sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their important contributions to this study.” About KEYLYNK-006 KEYLYNK-006 is a randomized, open-label, two-phase Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03976323 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin) followed by either KEYTRUDA plus maintenance LYNPARZA or KEYTRUDA plus maintenance chemotherapy (pemetrexed) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (ROS1) genomic tumor aberrations. The dual primary endpoints are PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR) and OS. The secondary endpoints include safety and health-related quality of life assessments. The trial enrolled an estimated 1,005 patients in the Induction Phase and randomized 672 patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease. In the Induction Phase, patients received KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV]) in combination with pemetrexed plus investigator’s choice of platinum chemotherapy, consisting of either carboplatin Area Under the Curve (AUC) (5 mg/mL/min IV) or cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 IV) every three weeks (Q3W) for four cycles. In the Maintenance Phase, patients with a complete or partial response or with stable disease after completing four cycles of induction therapy were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV Q3W for up to 31 cycles) plus maintenance LYNPARZA (300 mg orally twice daily) or KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV Q3W for up to 31 cycles) plus maintenance pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 IV Q3W) until progressive disease, physician decision or intolerable toxicity. About lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2022 alone, there were approximately 2.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. In 2024, the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25% in the United States. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. About Merck’s research in lung cancer Merck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has six approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is: stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Please see Prescribing Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_pi.pdf and Medication Guide for KEYTRUDA at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_mg.pdf . About LYNPARZA ® (olaparib) LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR. LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no contraindications for LYNPARZA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.2% of patients with various BRCA m, g BRCA m, HRR gene-mutated or HRD-positive cancers who received LYNPARZA as a single agent or as part of a combination regimen, consistent with the approved indications, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was approximately 2 years (range: <6 months to >4 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy. In SOLO-1, patients with newly diagnosed advanced BRCA m ovarian cancer, the incidence of MDS/AML was 1.9% (5/260) in patients who received LYNPARZA and 0.8% (1/130) in patients who received placebo based on an updated analysis. In PAOLA-1, of patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer with HRD-positive status, the incidence of MDS/AML was 1.6% (4/255) in patients who received LYNPARZA and 2.3% (3/131) in the control arm. In SOLO-2, patients with BRCA m platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, the incidence of MDS/AML was 8% (15/195) in patients who received LYNPARZA and 4% (4/99) in patients who received placebo. The duration of LYNPARZA treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from 0.6 years to 4.5 years. Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed. Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. In the combined data of two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies (PROfound and PROpel) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N=1180), VTE occurred in 8% of patients who received LYNPARZA, including pulmonary embolism in 6%. In the control arms, VTE occurred in 2.5%, including pulmonary embolism in 1.5%. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment. Females Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.

Additional data from GALACTIC-HF ( G lobal A pproach to L owering A dverse C ardiac Outcomes T hrough I mproving C ontractility in H eart F ailure) were also presented including a healthcare resource utilization analysis and an analysis of the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients. METEORIC-HF: No Effect of Treatment with Omecamtiv Mecarbil on Exercise Capacity METEORIC-HF evaluated the effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on exercise capacity as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following 20 weeks of treatment in patients with HFrEF receiving standard of care therapy. The trial enrolled 276 patients in 9 countries. At baseline, patients had an average left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 27% and an average peak oxygen uptake (pVO 2 ) of 14.7 ml/kg/min; 79% were New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II. After 20 weeks of treatment, there was no change in pVO 2 in patients treated with omecamtiv mecarbil versus placebo. Patients treated with omecamtiv mecarbil had an average change from baseline in pVO 2 of -0.2 ml/kg/min compared to 0.2 ml/kg/min for patients on placebo (p=0.13). There was no beneficial effect observed in any of the secondary endpoints, including change in total workload during exercise, change in ventilatory efficiency and change in daily physical activity. Adverse events, including major cardiac events, were similar between the treatment arms, even with patients reaching peak exercise. GALACTIC-HF: Treatment with Omecamtiv Mecarbil Led to 19% Cost Reduction Per Patient Among Patient Subgroup with Ejection Fraction Less than 30%, Without Atrial Fibrillation and Digoxin Nihar R. Desai , M.D., MPH, Associate Professor of Medicine, Associate Chief, Cardiovascular Medicine, Yale School of Medicine , Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation , presented new data on the healthcare resource use, intensity and costs among patients treated with omecamtiv mecarbil in GALACTIC-HF. In this analysis, a subgroup of 5,369 patients (65%) of the 8,256 patients enrolled in GALACTIC-HF met the specific criteria selected . The excluded patient subgroup comprised those who had atrial fibrillation and were taking digoxin or had an ejection fraction (EF) >30%. In the selected subgroup, omecamtiv mecarbil was associated with significant reductions in risk of a first heart failure event (relative risk reduction (RRR) 15%, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 3.8, number needed to treat (NNT) 26.2), total HF events (RRR 17%, ARR 6.8, NNT 14.7), and cumulative heart failure events. In this selected subgroup of 5,369 patients, treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil also significantly reduced resource intensity, measured by total days in hospital among patients being hospitalized (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.82–0.99). The estimated potential cost reductions within the selected subgroup related to heart failure events were $3,085 , a 19% reduction per patient. Of the cost reductions, 99% were due to heart failure hospitalizations avoided by those patients in GALACTIC-HF who were treated with omecamtiv mecarbil . GALACTIC-HF: Treatment with Omecamtiv Mecarbil Associated with Similar Risk Reduction in the Primary Composite Endpoint in Both Hospitalized Patients and Outpatients Kieran F. Docherty , M.D., Clinical Lecturer, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences , University of Glasgow presented additional data from GALACTIC-HF on the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil in hospitalized patients compared with outpatients. GALACTIC-HF was designed to enroll 25% of patients during hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Of 8,232 patients enrolled, 2,084 (25%) were hospitalized at the time of randomization, while 6,148 (75%) were randomized as outpatients. At baseline, compared with outpatients, hospitalized patients had higher NYHA Functional Class, were more likely to have atrial fibrillation, had lower systolic blood pressure, and had higher resting heart rate, more severe renal impairment, and higher NT-proBNP. The rate of the primary outcome was higher in hospitalized patients in the placebo group (38.3/100 person-years [PY]) than in outpatients (23.1/100 PY) with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.21 (95% CI 1.12, 1.31). There was a stepwise gradient in risk, with those randomized as outpatients in the placebo group within 3 months of a heart failure event at the highest risk (26.6/100 patient years (PY)) as compared with those 9-12 months post-event (19.0/100 PY) with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.20 (95% CI 1.01, 1.42), p for trend = 0.008). The effect of omecamtiv mecarbil versus placebo on the primary outcome was similar in hospitalized patients (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78, 1.01) and outpatients (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.86, 1.02), indicating that omecamtiv mecarbil similarly reduced the risk of the primary outcome both when initiated in hospitalized patients and in outpatients. In both hospitalized patients and outpatients, the initiation of omecamtiv mecarbil was safe and well tolerated. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred more frequently in patients randomized during hospitalization but did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. “The results of METEORIC-HF continue to emphasize the difficulty of improving exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction even as strides are made to improve clinical outcomes in these same patients. While there was no effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on exercise capacity in METEORIC-HF, we are encouraged that the results further reinforce the overall safety profile of omecamtiv mecarbil observed in GALACTIC-HF,” said Fady I. Malik , M.D., Ph.D., Cytokinetics’ Executive Vice President of Research & Development. “New and additional data from GALACTIC-HF continue to elaborate on our novel cardiac myosin activator including its impact on healthcare resource utilization and its use in both hospital and outpatient settings. These findings further our understanding of the potential benefit omecamtiv mecarbil may have in patients at risk for worsening heart failure, as well as the impact it may have on potential cost savings for the healthcare system.” About Omecamtiv Mecarbil Omecamtiv mecarbil is an investigational, selective, small molecule cardiac myosin activator, the first of a novel class of myotropes 1 designed to directly target the contractile mechanisms of the heart, binding to and recruiting more cardiac myosin heads to interact with actin during systole. Omecamtiv mecarbil was designed to increase the number of active actin-myosin cross bridges during each cardiac cycle and consequently augment the impaired contractility that is associated with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Preclinical research has shown that omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac contractility without increasing intracellular myocyte calcium concentrations or myocardial oxygen consumption. 2-4 The development program for omecamtiv mecarbil is assessing its potential for the treatment of HFrEF. Positive results from GALACTIC-HF, the first Phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil demonstrated a statistically significant effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to reduce risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or heart failure events (heart failure hospitalization and other urgent treatment for heart failure) compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care. No reduction in the secondary endpoint of time to CV death was observed. Adverse events and treatment discontinuation of study drug were balanced between treatment arms. The FDA has accepted for filing the NDA for omecamtiv mecarbil based on the results from GALACTIC-HF and has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of November 30, 2022. About Heart Failure Heart failure is a grievous condition that affects more than 64 million people worldwide 1 about half of whom have reduced left ventricular function. 2,3 It is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in people age 65 and older. 4,5 Despite broad use of standard treatments and advances in care, the prognosis for patients with heart failure is poor. 6 An estimated one in five people over the age of 40 are at risk of developing heart failure, and approximately 50 percent of people diagnosed with heart failure will die within five years of initial hospitalization. 7,8 More than 2 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have an ejection fraction <30%, indicating they may have severe heart failure. 9 About Cytokinetics Cytokinetics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and next-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised.

The BELINDA study did not meet its primary endpoint of event-free survival compared to treatment with the standard-of-care (SOC). SOC was salvage chemotherapy followed in responding patients by high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. The safety profile was consistent with the established safety profile of Kymriah. Novartis will complete a full evaluation of the BELINDA data and work with investigators on the future presentation of the results. “Patients with aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma who are refractory to first-line treatment are vulnerable and we are disappointed that the BELINDA study did not meet its primary endpoint in this setting,” said Jeff Legos, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Oncology & Hematology Development. “Kymriah continues to demonstrate durable responses for patients with certain advanced blood cancers in the third-line setting. We remain committed to accelerating development of Kymriah and our next-generation CAR-Ts and anticipate sharing early clinical results for these therapies at an upcoming medical meeting.” “We were hopeful the BELINDA study would show that Kymriah could improve outcomes and the overall treatment experience for these patients in need. The study investigators will work together with Novartis in the coming weeks and months to understand the factors that contributed to this outcome,” said Michael R. Bishop, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Program, University of Chicago Medicine and BELINDA Steering Committee Chair. Novartis is grateful to the patients, families and investigators who participated in this trial for their determination to contribute to advancing the treatment of this aggressive blood cancer. About the BELINDA study The BELINDA study is a pivotal Phase III, randomized, open label, multicenter trial comparing two treatment strategies and assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) compared to standard-of-care (SOC). Patients in the trial had aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with primary refractory disease, or which relapsed within 12 months of first-line treatment. SOC was salvage chemotherapy followed in responding patients by high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). This international trial enrolled patients from over 73 sites in 18 countries worldwide. The primary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or stable disease at or after the week 12 assessment, per blinded independent review committee (BIRC), or death at any time. Secondary endpoints include EFS as assessed by local investigator, overall survival, overall response rate, duration of response, time to response and safety. Patients in the control arm, receiving SOC, had the opportunity to cross over to receive Kymriah upon progression determined by BIRC. About Novartis Commitment to Oncology Cell & Gene Novartis has a mission to reimagine medicine by bringing curative cell & gene therapies to patients worldwide. Novartis was the first pharmaceutical company to significantly invest in pioneering CAR-T research and initiate global CAR-T trials. Kymriah, the first approved CAR-T cell therapy, developed in collaboration with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, is the foundation of the Novartis commitment to CAR-T cell therapy. Kymriah is currently approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adult (up to and including 25 years of age) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and r/r adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Kymriah is available in 30 countries and 330 certified treatment centers, with the ambition for further expansion. The Novartis global CAR-T manufacturing footprint spans seven facilities, across four continents and includes both Novartis-owned and contract manufacturing sites. This comprehensive, integrated footprint strengthens the flexibility, resilience and sustainability of the Novartis manufacturing and supply chain. US FDA approved indication for Kymriah Kymriah ® (tisagenlecleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy, which is indicated for: The treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse. The treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (FL). Limitations of Use: Kymriah is not indicated for treatment of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. Kymriah ® (tisagenlecleucel) US Important Safety information Kymriah may cause side effects that are severe or life-threatening, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) or Neurological Toxicities. Patients with CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness/lightheadedness. Patients may be admitted to the hospital for CRS and treated with other medications. Patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Patients should be advised to call their healthcare provider or get emergency help right away if they experience any of these signs and symptoms of CRS or neurological toxicities. Because of the risk of CRS and neurological toxicities, Kymriah is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS. Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur after Kymriah infusion. Kymriah can increase the risk of life-threatening infections that may lead to death. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they develop fever, chills, or any signs or symptoms of an infection. Patients may experience prolonged low blood cell counts (cytopenia), where one or more types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) are decreased. The patient's healthcare provider will do blood tests to check all of their blood cell counts after treatment with Kymriah. Patients should be advised to tell their healthcare provider right away if they get a fever, are feeling tired, or have bruising or bleeding. Patients may experience hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition in which the level of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood is low and the risk of infection is increased. It is expected that patients may develop hypogammaglobulinemia with Kymriah and may need to receive immunoglobulin replacement for an indefinite amount of time following treatment with Kymriah. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about their treatment with Kymriah before receiving a live virus vaccine. After treatment with Kymriah, patients will be monitored lifelong by their healthcare provider, as they may develop secondary cancers or recurrence of their cancer. Patients should not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities for eight weeks after receiving Kymriah because the treatment can cause temporary memory and coordination problems, including sleepiness, confusion, weakness, dizziness, and seizures. Some of the most common side effects of Kymriah are difficulty breathing, fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher), chills/shaking chills, confusion, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, dizziness/lightheadedness, and headache. However, these are not all of the possible side effects of Kymriah. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. Prior to a female patient starting treatment with Kymriah, their healthcare provider may do a pregnancy test. There is no information available for Kymriah use in pregnant or breast-feeding women. Therefore, Kymriah is not recommended for women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Patients should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and pregnancy. Patients should tell their healthcare provider about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. After receiving Kymriah, patients should be advised that some commercial HIV tests may cause a false-positive test result. Patients should also be advised not to donate blood, organs, or tissues and cells for transplantation after receiving Kymriah.

LEAP-006 : The Phase 3 LEAP-006 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA in combination with pemetrexed (Alimta ® ) and platinum-containing chemotherapy versus KEYTRUDA with pemetrexed and platinum-containing chemotherapy, a current standard of care option in this disease setting, as a first-line treatment for adult patients with metastatic, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have confirmation that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- , anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- or c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1)- directed therapies are not indicated, did not meet its dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). At the study’s final analysis, there was not an improvement in OS for patients treated with KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA with chemotherapy compared to KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy. Earlier interim analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or objective response rate (ORR), a key secondary endpoint. LEAP-008 : The Phase 3 LEAP-008 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus docetaxel, a current second line standard of care option, as a treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC who progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy and one prior anti-PD-1/-L1 immunotherapy, and have confirmation that EGFR- , ALK- or ROS1- directed therapies are not indicated, did not meet its dual primary endpoints of OS and PFS. At the final analysis of the study, there was not an improvement in OS for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA compared to docetaxel. Earlier interim analyses did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in PFS or ORR, a key secondary endpoint. In both the LEAP-006 and LEAP-008 trials, the safety profiles of the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA-based treatment regimens were consistent with that observed in previously reported studies evaluating the combination. A full evaluation of the data from these studies is ongoing. The companies will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community. “As a leader in lung cancer research, we continue to try to advance science for our patients by building upon the standard we set several years ago with KEYTRUDA,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “While these results are not what we hoped for, we are proud of the foundational role that KEYTRUDA has established in the treatment of certain types of lung cancer, and we are committed to continuing to research how we can further improve responses to our medicines for patients with difficult-to-treat forms of the disease.” “Despite great progress in recent years, unmet needs still remain in the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, particularly for those without targetable biomarkers,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Oncology at Eisai Inc. “KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA has demonstrated survival benefit in advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial carcinoma, and while we are disappointed that the final analyses of these non-small cell lung cancer studies did not show the same benefit, we remain committed to applying learnings from these studies and furthering research in oncology for people with unmet needs. We thank all the patients, their families and the investigators involved.” KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYX for advanced RCC in the EU. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in various tumor types, including but not limited to endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, RCC, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer across multiple clinical trials. Results from the LEAP-006 and LEAP-008 trials do not affect the current approved indications for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination or other ongoing trials from the LEAP clinical program. About LEAP-006 LEAP-006 is a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03829319 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA with pemetrexed and platinum-containing chemotherapy versus KEYTRUDA plus placebo with pemetrexed and platinum- containing chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic, nonsquamous NSCLC who have confirmation that EGFR- , ALK- or ROS1- directed therapies are not indicated. The dual primary endpoints are PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RESIST v1.1) modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR and duration of response (DOR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, quality of life, and safety. The study enrolled an estimated 748 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive: KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle [Q3W]) plus LENVIMA (8 mg orally once daily) with pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 IV Q3W and carboplatin Area Under Curve 5 mg/mL/min (AUC5) or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 Q3W IV; or KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV Q3W) plus placebo (oral capsule once daily) with pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 IV Q3W and carboplatin AUC5 or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 Q3W IV. All study drugs were continued until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria. KEYTRUDA was administered for up to 35 cycles (approximately two years). After completing two years of combination therapy, LENVIMA may have been administered as a single agent until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. Carboplatin or cisplatin was administered for up to four cycles. The LEAP-006 study was conducted in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company, the makers of Alimta ® (pemetrexed). About LEAP-008 LEAP-008 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03976375 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC who progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy and one prior anti-PD-1/-L1 therapy, and have confirmation that EGFR- , ALK- or ROS1- directed therapies are not indicated. The trial’s dual primary endpoints are PFS, as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. Secondary endpoints include ORR and DOR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, quality of life and safety. The study enrolled an estimated 422 patients who were randomized 4:4:1 to receive: KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV every three weeks) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily); or Docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 IV every three weeks); or LENVIMA (24 mg orally once daily). KEYTRUDA was administered for up to 35 cycles (approximately two years) or until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. After completing two years of combination therapy, LENVIMA may have been administered as a single agent until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. About lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer in the U.S., accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, reduction in smoking, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is: stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Please see Prescribing Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_pi.pdf and Medication Guide for KEYTRUDA at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_mg.pdf . About LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone.

Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA Warnings and Precautions Hypertension. In DTC (differentiated thyroid cancer), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC (renal cell carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC. Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity. Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Among patients receiving LENVIMA with pembrolizumab, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%). Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients.

If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%.

In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity. Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms. Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC. Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA. Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution. Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.

(Nasdaq: BIIB) announced topline results from the Phase 2 PASSPORT study of gosuranemab (BIIB092) for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The primary endpoint, as measured by the PSP rating scale (PSPRS) at week 52, was not statistically significant. In addition, the study did not demonstrate efficacy on key clinical secondary endpoints. Based on these results, Biogen will discontinue development of gosuranemab for PSP and other primary tauopathies. “We are disappointed with the efficacy results of the Phase 2 PASSPORT study,” said Alfred Sandrock Jr., M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer at Biogen. “We remain unwavering in our commitment to advancing therapies that have the potential to address the significant unmet medical needs of people with neurodegenerative diseases who are faced with limited to no treatment options.” Safety results of the PASSPORT study were generally consistent with previous studies of gosuranemab. Detailed results of this study will be made available in a future scientific forum. Biogen will continue its ongoing Phase 2 TANGO study of gosuranemab for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or mild AD, given differences in disease pathology. About Gosuranemab Gosuranemab (BIIB092) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets N-terminal tau. Gosuranemab-mediated removal of N-terminal tau is being studied to evaluate whether it slows the progression of disease in tauopathies. TANGO, a Phase 2 study, is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of gosuranemab in participants with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease or with mild Alzheimer’s disease. Biogen licensed gosuranemab from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. About Biogen At Biogen, our mission is clear: we are pioneers in neuroscience.

The key message from the data is that the proven efficacy of Lucentis monotherapy was not improved by the addition of pegpleranib"", said Vasant Narasimhan, Global Head, Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. ""Together with Ophthotech we continue to analyze the data. We are confident that underlying data will provide further understanding and guidance on how best to help patients with this disease. Novartis continues researching new treatment options for patients with nAMD, and we are looking forward to the phase III results of our next generation treatment RTH258."" Data from the OPH1002 and OPH1003 studies, including secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints, will be presented at a future medical meeting. About the OPH1002 and OPH1003 studies The OPH1002 and OPH1003 studies are both randomized, double blind, Phase III clinical trial studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pegpleranib 1.5mg in combination with ranibizumab versus ranibizumab monotherapy in people with subfoveal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)[1],[2]. A total of 1,248 patients over the age of 50 were enrolled across both studies (621 patients in the OPH1002 study and 627 patients in the OPH1003 study)[6] and were randomized to receive either pegpleranib in combination with ranibizumab or ranibizumab alone each month up to the 12 month primary endpoint of the study[1],[2]. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was defined as mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at 12 months. A number of secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints are currently being analyzed across both studies[1],[2]. About nAMD Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common and degenerative eye condition caused by damage to the macula[3], and is globally ranked as the third most common cause of blindness[7]. The disease is a leading cause of vision loss in people aged over 50 years[3] and impacts an estimated 20 to 25 million people worldwide[4]. It is the primary cause of blindness in industrialized countries[7]. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD or wet AMD) occurs when abnormal blood vessels form underneath the macula and cause damage to the cells, particularly if they leak blood and fluid into the eye[8]. Without treatment, vision deteriorates within days[8]. About pegpleranib Pegpleranib is a 32-mer pegylated DNA aptamer that selectively binds to PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB homo and hetero-dimers, respectively, thereby disrupting the interaction with their cognate tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGF-BB with PDGFR-alpha alpha, PDGFR -ßß and PDGFR-alpha ß; PDGF-AB with PDGFR-alpha alpha and PDGFR-alpha ß). These receptors are commonly expressed on cells of mesenchymal origin such as pericytes[9]-[13].. In a preclinical model, pegpleranib potently stripped neovascular pericytes from the underlying endothelial cells[14]. Pericyte stripping from a neovascular complex may leave the underlying endothelial cells in an unprotected and vulnerable state, thereby increasing their sensitivity to the effects of VEGF blockade[9]-[10],[12],[15]-[17]. Pegpleranib is currently being investigated in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD or wet AMD)[1],[2],[5] About the Ophthotech and Novartis license and commercialization agreement In May 2014, Novartis signed a license and commercialization agreement with Ophthotech Corporation (Ophthotech) and holds the exclusive rights to pegpleranib outside the United States. Ophthotech holds the rights to pegpleranib in the United States.

The study, which evaluated trebananib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel, did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Median overall survival was 19.3 months in the trebananib arm versus 18.3 months in the control arm. The data will be submitted to a future medical conference and for publication. In the previously reported primary endpoint analysis, the data demonstrated a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival for trebananib. In that analysis, patients treated with trebananib showed a 34 percent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR = 0.66, 95 percent CI, 0.57, 0.77, p <0.001). The median progression-free survival was 7.2 months in the trebananib arm versus 5.4 months in the control arm. ""While the overall survival results of the TRINOVA-1 study are disappointing, this study is the first of three Phase 3 trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of trebananib in patients with ovarian cancer,"" said Sean E. Harper , M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen . ""We continue to explore the potential of trebananib's novel anti-tumor mechanism of action in other cancer settings."" In the trebananib arm, the most frequently reported adverse events were localized edema, nausea and alopecia. The rate of discontinuation of investigational product due to adverse events was 20 percent in the trebananib arm versus seven percent in the control arm. No new safety signals were detected. Data from another trial in the recurrent platinum-resistant population (TRINOVA-2) is expected in Q4 2014. Data from a trial evaluating trebananib in combination with first-line chemotherapy treatment for patients with ovarian cancer (TRINOVA-3) is expected in 2015. TRINOVA-1 Trial Design (NCT01204749) TRINOVA-1 (A Study of AMG 386 or Placebo, in Combination With Weekly Paclitaxel Chemotherapy, as Treatment for Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancer and Fallopian Tube Cancer) is a Phase 3 global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating trebananib in over 900 women with recurrent partially platinum-sensitive or -resistant (platinum-free interval of 12 months or less) epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either 15 mg/kg of intravenous trebananib weekly plus 80 mg/m2 of intravenous paclitaxel weekly (three weeks on, one week off) or weekly intravenous placebo plus 80 mg/m2 of intravenous paclitaxel weekly (three weeks on, one week off). Other ongoing Phase 3 studies of trebananib include TRINOVA-2 and TRINOVA-3. TRINOVA-2 is evaluating whether trebananib plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is superior to placebo plus PLD as measured by progression-free survival in recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. TRINOVA-3 is evaluating trebananib or placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in the first-line treatment of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. About Trebananib Trebananib is an investigational peptibody designed to inhibit the angiopoietin axis. The angiopoietin axis is involved in angiogenesis, a process used by the body to grow new blood vessels, which is also involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases.  Trebananib is designed to bind to both angiopoietin-1 and -2 (Ang1 and Ang2), and inhibit their interaction with the Tie2 receptor. 1,2,3 Ang1 and Ang2 each mediate separate actions upon binding with Tie2. 4,5 Ang1 impacts vessel quality while Ang2 influences vessel quantity. The angiopoietins are also involved in lymphangiogenesis, the formation of new lymphatic vessels, which plays a key role in tumor metastasis. 6 About Ovarian Cancer About 21,980 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. in 2014 and about 14,270 women will die from ovarian cancer. 7 More than 70 percent of women with ovarian cancer will present with advanced disease at diagnosis and up to 80 percent of them will experience disease recurrence and eventually die from their disease. 8,9 About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) reports filed by Amgen Inc., including Amgen Inc.'s most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Please refer to Amgen Inc.'s most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K for additional information on the uncertainties and risk factors related to our business. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of Nov. 4, 2014, and expressly disclaims any duty to update information contained in this news release. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us and our partners to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. We depend on third parties for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of our current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, sales of our products (including products of our wholly-owned subsidiaries) are affected by the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement. Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of our products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to some of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. We believe that some of our newer products, product candidates or new indications for existing products, may face competition when and as they are approved and marketed. Our products may compete against products that have lower prices, established reimbursement, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with our products. In addition, while Amgen and its partners routinely obtain patents for their products and technology, the protection of our products offered by patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our or our partners' competitors and there can be no guarantee of our or our partners' ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products or product candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to produce commercially successful products or maintain the commercial success of our existing products. Our stock price may be affected by actual or perceived market opportunity, competitive position, and success or failure of our products or product candidates. Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. Cost saving initiatives may result in us incurring impairment or other related charges on our assets. We may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plans. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or their ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative.

(Nasdaq: BBIO) today announced topline results from Month 12 (Part A) of ATTRibute-CM, an ongoing global Phase 3 study investigating acoramidis for the treatment of symptomatic transthyretin (TTR) amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). The mean observed decline in 6MWD at Month 12 in participants receiving acoramidis or placebo with baseline eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 were 9 meters and 7 meters, respectively. Decline observed in both arms of ATTRibute-CM was similar to expected functional decline in healthy elderly adults. 1 The declines were also substantially less than the >40 meter annual declines observed in previous untreated arms reviewed by the company. 2 The decline in the ATTRibute-CM placebo group was more than 70% lower than the decline observed in the ATTR-ACT treatment group. 2 The ATTRibute-CM independent data monitoring committee recommends continuing the study based on unblinded data reviews. Despite the unexpected performance of the six-minute walk test, the trial’s steering committee co-chairs and the Company agree that there is potential for acoramidis to demonstrate benefit on the Month 30 endpoint which includes all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. “This result is disappointing and baffling. I am, along with many others, searching for answers regarding the 6MWD,” said Neil Kumar, Ph.D., founder and CEO of BridgeBio. “The results do not appear to be due to a baseline imbalance. The hypotheses we are currently evaluating include context bias, training bias, and an evolution in diagnosis and standard of care. The drug does appear to be pharmacologically active and well-tolerated, and we observed improvement on quality of life with promising trends on adverse events leading to death. The drug seems to be doing what we are asking of it. If we observe enough clinical outcome events at Month 30, I am still hopeful that we will demonstrate the benefit of acoramidis treatment.” “Although these results were not what we hoped, the most important moment in this trial will be the Part B readout at 30 months, where we will see the effects of acoramidis on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. From what I’ve seen so far, I remain enthusiastic about getting to that endpoint,” said Daniel Judge, M.D., professor in the Division of Cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina, and co-chair of the ATTRibute-CM Steering Committee. ATTRibute-CM enrolled 632 participants with symptomatic ATTR-CM, associated with either wild-type or variant TTR, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I-III symptoms. The study is designed as a two-part study with Part A (Month 12) comparing change from baseline in 6MWD and Part B (Month 30) utilizing a hierarchical comparison including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations. ATTRibute-CM enrolled a similar patient population as ATTR-ACT, excepting a smaller proportion of U.S. participants and TTR variant carriers. Participants were randomized 2:1 between treatment (acoramidis 800 mg) and placebo twice daily. Based on data available after 12 months of treatment, the Company observed: In the primary analysis, change from baseline in 6MWD was not improved in the acoramidis arm relative to the placebo arm (p = 0.76) Key differences in NYHA class, geographic distribution, and TTR variant status compared to the ATTR-ACT population do not appear to have affected the primary outcome of ATTRibute-CM The only participant sub-population the company has reviewed to date that exhibited substantial placebo decline in 6MWD by Month 12 was the variant population. In that population, observed decline in placebo and acoramidis was -40 meters and -2 meters, respectively Acoramidis improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score relative to placebo (nominal p < 0.05, mixed model repeated measures without imputation) Acoramidis improved NT-proBNP relative to placebo. Median percent change from baseline at Month 12 in acoramidis-treated and placebo-treated participants were +0.6% and +24.3%, respectively (nominal p < 0.05 based on absolute changes from baseline between groups) Acoramidis increased serum TTR levels relative to placebo. Mean percent change from baseline at Month 12 in acoramidis-treated and placebo-treated participants were +38.5% and -0.7%, respectively (nominal p < 0.01 based on absolute changes from baseline between groups) Acoramidis was generally well-tolerated with no safety signals of clinical concern identified. To protect the integrity of Part B, the Sponsor’s access to unblinded adverse event data for Part A excludes AEs leading to a cardiovascular hospitalization (as determined by investigators) excepting events with the outcome of death Adverse events occurred in 85.3% of placebo-treated participants and 91.9% of acoramidis-treated participants Serious adverse events occurred in 23.2% of placebo-treated participants and 20.2% of acoramidis-treated participants Adverse events with outcome of death occurred in 6.2% of placebo-treated participants and 4.5% of acoramidis-treated participants BridgeBio is well-capitalized through the completion of ATTRibute-CM and remains on track to deliver on additional catalysts in 2022 and 2023. “With the financing announced in November 2021, we currently have approximately $800 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with access to up to $300 million on achieving portfolio milestones through year-end 2022. We have ongoing clinical trials in multiple genetic diseases, including achondroplasia, autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1, limb-girdle muscle dystrophy type 2i and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver in 2022,” said Brian Stephenson, Ph.D., chief financial officer of BridgeBio. 1 Enright, P.L. et al.

About Acoramidis Acoramidis (AG10) is an investigational, orally-administered small molecule designed to potently stabilize tetrameric transthyretin, or TTR, thereby halting at its outset the series of molecular events that give rise to TTR amyloidosis, or ATTR. Acoramidis is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in patients with ATTR. Acoramidis was designed to mimic a naturally -occurring variant of the TTR gene (T119M) that is considered a “rescue mutation” because it has been shown to prevent or minimize ATTR in individuals carrying pathogenic, or disease-causing, mutations in the TTR gene. About Transthyretin Amyloidosis (ATTR) Likely affecting more than 400,000 patients globally, ATTR is an underdiagnosed and life-threatening disease with limited treatment options that can devastate the heart and nervous system. When the transthyretin (TTR) becomes unstable due to inherited variants or aging, it can accumulate as amyloid fibrils in various organs in the body, causing ATTR. TTR amyloid deposits predominantly in the heart and/or peripheral nerves, causing cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) and/or polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN). ATTR often dramatically impairs the quality of life, functional independence and life expectancy of patients, as well as impacting caregivers due to the progressive nature of the disease. If left untreated life expectancy from diagnosis is approximately four years. About BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.

No unexpected safety signals were observed. 1 Findings from the trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. “We made an investment in the CANOPY program based on signals of reduced lung cancer incidence and mortality observed in the CANTOS study. These positive signals supported the study of canakinumab as adjuvant treatment for early lung cancer,” said Jeff Legos, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Oncology & Hematology Development, Novartis. “While we are disappointed CANOPY-A did not show the benefit we hoped for, every trial generates scientific evidence that supports future research and development, and we look forward to continuing to pursue new therapeutic options for people living with lung cancer, whose needs remain urgent and significant. We thank the patients and clinical investigators whose time and commitment made this research possible.” CANOPY-A is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double blind study that is evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab as adjuvant treatment in patients with NSCLC stages II-IIIA and IIIB (T>5cm N2), per American Joint Committee on Cancer/The Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) 8 th edition staging, whose margins are free of cancer following surgery 2 . In the trial, 1,382 patients were randomized 1:1 to canakinumab, 200 mg subcutaneously every three weeks, or matching placebo for up to one year 2 . Patients completed standard-of-care adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy, if applicable, prior to randomization 2 . About canakinumab (ACZ885) Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to human IL-1β and inhibits IL-1β activity by blocking its interaction with its receptors 3-5 . By inhibiting IL-1β, preliminary evidence suggests that canakinumab may suppress Pro-Tumor Inflammation to 1) enhance anti-tumor immune response; 2) reduce tumor cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness; and 3) impair angiogenesis 5 . Pro-Tumor Inflammation enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses 6,7 . About the CANOPY program Novartis launched the CANOPY study program after observing significantly lower than expected rates of lung cancer mortality among patients in the Phase III cardiovascular CANTOS trial. The CANTOS trial evaluated canakinumab as a secondary prevention measure for cardiovascular events in patients following a heart attack 5, 8 . Patients in the CANTOS trial also were at high risk for inflammatory cancers like lung cancer due to advanced age, smoking history, and other clinical risk factors 5,8 . Based on these findings, Novartis launched three large-scale, randomized, Phase III clinical trials and a Phase II clinical trial to investigate canakinumab as a potential treatment option in NSCLC. Novartis and lung cancer Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for more than 2 million new cases diagnosed each year 9 . More people die of lung cancer every year than any other cancer 9 . There are two main types of lung cancer—small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 10 . NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses 11 , and 30-55% of patients with early NSCLC develop recurrence despite resection 12 . Novartis is committed to working with the scientific and medical communities to reimagine the treatment of lung cancer and pursue advances in medicine that could extend the survival of people living with lung cancer. Novartis is developing experimental therapies that block cancer growth; learning more about ways to activate the body’s immune system; increasing understanding of the relationship between chronic inflammation and tumor growth and progression; and exploring the potential for advanced nuclear medicine to fight the disease.

The trial narrowly missed statistical significance for its composite primary endpoint of reducing cardiovascular death and total heart failure hospitalizations[1]. Safety and tolerability were consistent with previously reported sacubitril/valsartan data[1]. ""Around half of all heart failure patients, some 13 million people worldwide, are estimated to suffer from HFpEF, and there is currently no approved treatment. We embarked upon the landmark Phase III PARAGON-HF trial to determine whether sacubitril/valsartan could have a meaningful impact on the treatment of HFpEF, as it does in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction,"" said John McMurray, M.D., Professor of Medical Cardiology at University of Glasgow and PARAGON-HF Executive Committee Co-Chair. ""We look forward to presenting and discussing the data from PARAGON-HF, which should inform our understanding and treatment of HFpEF, at the ESC Congress 2019,"" said Scott Solomon, M.D., Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and PARAGON-HF Executive Committee Co-Chair. ""The totality of evidence from the trial suggests that treatment with sacubitril/valsartan may result in clinically important benefits in HFpEF. We will be discussing potential next steps with clinical experts and regulators while we prepare to present the full results at the ESC Congress 2019 in September,"" said John Tsai, M.D., Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis, ""We thank the patients, investigators and site personnel around the world for their support during the PARAGON-HF study."" There is currently no approved treatment for HFpEF[2],[3]. Sacubitril/valsartan (approved as Entresto ® since 2015) is a first-choice treatment in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), based on its superiority to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and its ability to significantly reduce CV death and HFrEF hospitalizations[4],[5],[6]. Novartis continues to study sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF, with new data on cardiac remodeling being presented at the ESC Congress 2019. Detailed PARAGON-HF results will also be reported at that time. Additional studies investigating sacubitril/valsartan on other relevant endpoints in HFpEF are ongoing[8],[9]. About PARAGON-HF PARAGON-HF is the largest clinical trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) conducted to date[7]. The Phase III randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active-controlled, 2-arm, event-driven trial compared the long-term efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan versus valsartan in 4,822 patients with HFpEF[7]. The patients in the study represented ambulatory patients with established HFpEF being treated for symptoms and comorbidities, approximately half of whom had a history of heart failure hospitalizations[1],[7]. The primary endpoint of the trial is the composite of total (first and recurrent) heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death[7]. PARAGON-HF is part of FortiHFy, the largest global clinical program in the heart failure disease area across the pharmaceutical industry to date. Established by Novartis, the FortiHFy program comprises more than 40 active or planned clinical studies designed to generate an array of additional data on symptom reduction, efficacy, quality of life benefits and real world evidence with sacubitril/valsartan, as well as to extend understanding of heart failure. PARAGON-HF follows the only positive Phase II trial in HFpEF, PARAMOUNT-HF, which demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan reduced NT-proBNP (a biomarker of cardiac strain) to a greater extent than valsartan at 12 weeks and was associated with improvement in NYHA class at 36 weeks.  Additional studies investigating sacubitril/valsartan on other relevant endpoints in HFpEF are ongoing.[8],[9]. About Heart Failure Heart failure (HF) is a progressive and serious condition, affecting approximately 26 million people worldwide, where the heart cannot pump enough blood to the body[2],[10],[11]. There are two distinct types of heart failure: preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)[12]. About HFpEF HFpEF is a distinct type of heart failure where the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricles do not relax as they should during ventricular filling (or when the ventricles relax)[13]. HFpEF can be associated with high hospitalization rates, poor quality of life and increased mortality[14], and it is emerging as the predominant form of HF[15]. There is currently no approved treatment for HFpEF[2],[3]. About HFrEF HFrEF is a certain type of long-lasting heart failure, also known as systolic HF[16],[17]. HFrEF means the heart does not contract with enough force, so less blood is pumped out[13]. There are approved treatment options for people living with HFrEF[2],[5]. About Entresto for Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) Entresto is a twice-a-day medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart[4]. It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (natriuretic peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)[4],[18]. Other common heart failure medicines, called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS. Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the ARB valsartan[4],[19]. In Europe, Entresto is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction[4]. In the United States, Entresto is indicated for the treatment of heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) in patients with systolic dysfunction[19]. It has been shown to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization and 30-day hospital readmission compared to enalapril, to reduce the rate of all-cause mortality compared to enalapril, and to improve aspects of health-related quality of life (including physical and social activities) compared to enalapril[20],[21],[22]. Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an ACE inhibitor or other ARB[4],[19]. Approved indications may vary depending upon the individual country.

(Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced top-line results from its 298 patient Phase 3 CLARITY study which combined two identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of pimavanserin as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The combined efficacy and safety analysis was pre-specified prior to data unblinding following feedback from the FDA. The study did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint which was the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score change from baseline to week 5. Pimavanserin 34 mg, given once-daily as an adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressant therapy was associated with a mean reduction of 9.0 in HAMD-17 total score compared to 8.1 for placebo as an adjunctive treatment (p=0.296). Positive results were observed on the key secondary endpoint, the Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) score, a clinician assessment of a patient’s severity of depression (nominal p=0.042). “We observed a consistent improvement of depressive symptoms over time with pimavanserin but, unfortunately, the robust positive results from our CLARITY-1 study were not replicated,” said Serge Stankovic , ACADIA’s President. “While these results do not support the product profile to pursue an additional Phase 3 study in adjunctive MDD, we will continue to analyze the data and the findings from our earlier positive depression studies as we assess next steps. All of us at ACADIA thank the patients, their families and the investigators who participated in the Phase 3 CLARITY study.” In the study, pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated when added to existing antidepressant therapy, and similar rates of adverse events were observed between pimavanserin (58.1%) and placebo (54.7%). About the Phase 3 CLARITY Study The Phase 3 CLARITY study is a combination of CLARITY-2 and CLARITY-3, which were both 6-week, parallel-designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin as adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy with either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). A total of 298 patients were randomized to receive six weeks of oral treatment with either 34 mg of pimavanserin or placebo, once daily, in addition to their ongoing antidepressant. The primary endpoint was change from baseline on the HAMD-17 total score. Phase 3 CLARITY Study Results: Efficacy Analysis Statistical significance not achieved on the primary endpoint: HAMD-17 (p=0.296). Positive results observed on key secondary endpoint: CGI-S (nominal p=0.042). Positive results observed on Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) score (nominal p=0.005). Clinically meaningful separation was not achieved on the other secondary endpoints. Safety and Tolerability Similar rates of adverse events were observed between pimavanserin (58.1%) and placebo (54.7%). Adverse events reported in greater than 5% of patients on pimavanserin and greater than placebo were diarrhea, dry mouth and headache. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 2.7% for both pimavanserin and placebo. Two subjects in each of the pimavanserin and placebo groups reported serious adverse events (SAEs). These SAEs were deemed not to be related to the study drug by the investigators. The adjunctive use of pimavanserin did not result in clinically significant differences in vital signs, metabolic parameters or extrapyramidal symptoms compared to placebo. ACADIA previously announced plans to combine its CLARITY-2 and CLARITY-3 Phase 3 studies evaluating pimavanserin for the adjunctive treatment of MDD with a pre-specified statistical analysis plan. The two Phase 3 studies concluded with slightly more than 50% enrollment. Patients who completed the Phase 3 study were eligible to participate in the ongoing 52-week open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of pimavanserin as adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressants in MDD. About the CLARITY-1 Study CLARITY-1 was a Phase 2, 10-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, 2-stage sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pimavanserin (34 mg once daily) as an adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of standard antidepressant therapy with either a SSRI or a SNRI. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Trials Network & Institute and randomized 207 patients across 27 clinical research centers in the U.S. and was completed in 2018. In the trial, pimavanserin met the primary endpoint by significantly reducing the HAMD-17 total score compared to placebo (p=0.039). On the key secondary endpoint, pimavanserin demonstrated statistically significant reductions compared to placebo in the Sheehan Disability Scale score (p=0.004). Positive results were also observed for seven other secondary endpoints including the CGI-S score (p=0.008) and the KSS score (p=0.021). In the parallel design portion (Stage 1) of this SPCD study, adding pimavanserin to SSRI or SNRI therapy also significantly reduced HAMD-17 scores compared to placebo (p=0.0003). On the key secondary endpoint, pimavanserin also demonstrated statistically significant reductions compared to placebo in the Sheehan Disability Scale score (p=0.004). About the Open-Label Comorbid Parkinson’s Disease and Depression Study This was an 8-week, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin as an adjunct to a SSRI or a SNRI or as a monotherapy in adults with both Parkinson’s disease and depression (n=47) and was completed in 2019. In the study, patients treated with pimavanserin had significant improvement on the primary endpoint, the HAMD-17 total score change in baseline to week 8 (p<0.0001), with significant improvement seen as early as week 2 (p<0.0001). Improvement of ≥50% on the HAMD-17 total score was observed in 60.0% of patients at week 8, with 44.4% of patients reaching remission (HAMD-17 ≤7). Additional results from this study showed that Parkinson’s disease patients treated with pimavanserin for depression also demonstrated improvement on multiple secondary endpoints compared to baseline, including the CGI-S score (p<0.0001) and the SCOPA-Global Sleep Quality scale (p<0.0001).

About Major Depressive Disorder According to the National Institute of Mental Health , MDD affects approximately 17 million adults in the U.S. 1 , with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. 2,3 MDD is a condition characterized by depressive symptoms such as a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities for more than two weeks, as well as impaired social, occupational, or other important functioning. Continuing depression has been consistently linked with greater economic burden, with higher rate of healthcare utilization and reduced work productivity. 4 The majority of people who suffer from MDD do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy or discontinue due to side effects or safety concerns. 5,6 About Pimavanserin Pimavanserin is a selective serotonin inverse agonist and antagonist preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. The serotonin system is thought to play an important role in neuropsychiatric disorders. In vitro, pimavanserin demonstrated no appreciable binding affinity for dopamine (including D2), histamine, muscarinic, or adrenergic receptors. Pimavanserin was approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 2016 under the trade name NUPLAZID ® . ACADIA submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis on June 3, 2020 . The FDA has accepted for filing the sNDA for DRP with a PDUFA date of April 3, 2021 . NUPLAZID is not approved for dementia-related psychosis. In addition, ACADIA is developing pimavanserin in other neuropsychiatric conditions. About ACADIA Pharmaceuticals ACADIA is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system disorders.

Important Safety Information and Indication for NUPLAZID (pimavanserin) Indication NUPLAZID is indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. Important Safety Information WARNING: INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. NUPLAZID is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis unrelated to the hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. Contraindication: NUPLAZID is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to pimavanserin or any of its components. Rash, urticaria, and reactions consistent with angioedema (e.g., tongue swelling, circumoral edema, throat tightness, and dyspnea) have been reported. Warnings and Precautions: QT Interval Prolongation NUPLAZID prolongs the QT interval. The use of NUPLAZID should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs known to prolong QT interval including Class 1A antiarrhythmics or Class 3 antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotic medications, and certain antibiotics. NUPLAZID should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Adverse Reactions: The common adverse reactions (≥2% for NUPLAZID and greater than placebo) were peripheral edema (7% vs 2%), nausea (7% vs 4%), confusional state (6% vs 3%), hallucination (5% vs 3%), constipation (4% vs 3%), and gait disturbance (2% vs <1%). Drug Interactions: Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases NUPLAZID exposure. Reduce NUPLAZID dose to 10 mg taken orally as one tablet once daily. Coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers reduces NUPLAZID exposure. Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with NUPLAZID.

This presentation follows a prior announcement that the trial did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline in slow vital capacity (SVC) which was evaluated at 24 weeks following randomization or any of the secondary endpoints in the trial which were evaluated at 48 weeks. The results were presented by Jeremy Shefner , M.D., Ph.D., Lead Investigator of VITALITY-ALS, Professor and Chair of Neurology at Barrow Neurological Institute , and Professor and Executive Chair of Neurology at University of Arizona , Phoenix . “Although we are profoundly disappointed with these results, we believe that data from VITALITY-ALS provide validation for the mechanism of action of fast skeletal muscle troponin activation. The  effects of tirasemtiv observed in patients with ALS support the future development of CK-2127107, our next-generation fast skeletal muscle troponin activator which is the subject of FORTITUDE-ALS, our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with ALS,” said Robert I. Blum , Cytokinetics’ President and CEO. “As recently published Phase 1 studies demonstrate, CK-2127107 may be more effective and better tolerated than tirasemtiv . We are humbled by the outpouring of support we have received from the ALS community and will continue our search for a potential therapy to slow the progressive respiratory decline and muscle weakness which characterize this dreadful disease.” “VITALITY-ALS did not achieve our pre-specified objectives which included improving tolerability in ALS patients by altering the dosing of tirasemtiv ,” said Dr. Shefner. “The increased numbers of non-serious adverse effects and drop-outs in patients who received tirasemtiv confound our ability to evaluate efficacy and safety in the primary analyses of VITALITY-ALS. Additional analyses of patients able to tolerate tirasemtiv suggest slowing of the decline in SVC, providing support for the continued investigation of fast skeletal muscle troponin activators in patients with ALS.” VITALITY-ALS randomized patients to placebo and three target doses of tirasemtiv (250, 375, and 500 mg/day) in a 3:2:2:2 ratio. The primary analysis was an intent to treat analysis of the dose groups of tirasemtiv pooled together and compared to placebo. The least squares mean change from baseline in percent predicted SVC was ‑13.4 percentage points in the patients randomized to tirasemtiv compared to -14.4 percentage points in those randomized to placebo. The least squares mean difference from baseline to 24 weeks between tirasemtiv and placebo was 0.92 percentage points (p=0.5552). In a pre-specified analysis of the average daily maintenance dose of tirasemtiv actually taken (rather than as randomized), patients who completed VITALITY-ALS at the highest average daily dose of tirasemtiv (> 437.5 mg/day), experienced the largest difference from placebo in change from baseline to 24 weeks in percent predicted SVC, although the difference was not statistically significant (least squares mean difference from placebo: 4.57, p=0.107). VITALITY-ALS did not meet any of the pre-specified secondary endpoints which were evaluated at 48 weeks. Of the 565 randomized patients who received double-blind treatment in the trial, 188 received placebo and 377 received tirasemtiv . 165 (87.8 percent) of patients on placebo completed 24 weeks of treatment, while 248 (65.8 percent) of patients on tirasemtiv completed 24 weeks of treatment. Serious adverse events in patients receiving tirasemtiv were consistent with disease progression of ALS with no meaningful differences from placebo. Mortality was also similar in patients receiving tirasemtiv and placebo. No new safety or tolerability findings related to tirasemtiv were identified in VITALITY-ALS. The adverse events with the greatest differences in frequency between patients receiving tirasemtiv and those on placebo were dizziness, weight decrease, insomnia, fatigue and nausea, consistent with the adverse event profile of tirasemtiv observed in Phase 2. About VITALITY-ALS and VIGOR-ALS VITALITY-ALS was a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with possible, probable or definite ALS, diagnosed within 24 months, and with SVC at baseline ≥ 70 percent predicted. The primary endpoint of the trial assessed change from baseline in SVC after 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment. Secondary endpoints, assessed at 48 weeks, included change from baseline in the score of the three respiratory items of the ALSFRS-R (i.e., the sum of items 10, 11 and 12) at 48 weeks; slope of the mega-score of muscle strength at 48 weeks; time to the first occurrence of a decline from baseline in percent predicted SVC ≥20 percentage points or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or death through 48 weeks; time to the first occurrence of a decline in SVC to ≤50 percent predicted or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or death through 48 weeks; change from baseline in the ALSFRS-R total score at 48 weeks; and time to the first use of mechanical ventilatory assistance or death through 48 weeks. Patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS received two-weeks of open-label treatment with tirasemtiv administered at 250 mg/day. Patients were then randomized into a double-blind treatment phase to placebo or one of three target tirasemtiv dose levels (250 mg/day, 375 mg/day, 500 mg/day) in a 3:2:2:2 ratio. After 48 weeks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment, patients who received tirasemtiv during those 48 weeks of double-blind treatment were randomized to continue the dose of tirasemtiv at which they completed the 48 weeks of double-blind treatment or to placebo for a four-week double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase.  Patients who received placebo during the 48 weeks of double-blind treatment continued to receive placebo during the double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase. Following their participation in VITALITY-ALS, patients were eligible to participate in an open-label extension study of tirasemtiv , VIGOR-ALS ( V entilatory I nvestigations in G lobal O pen-label R esearch in ALS ), designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS. Cytokinetics will seek advice from the academic leadership of VITALITY-ALS and its clinical investigators, regulatory authorities and other consultants before making decisions about continuing treatment with tirasemtiv in VIGOR-ALS. About ALS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that afflicts approximately 30,000 people in the United States and a comparable number of patients in Europe . Approximately 6,000 new cases of ALS are diagnosed each year in the United States . The average life expectancy of an ALS patient is approximately three to five years after diagnosis and only 10 percent of patients survive for more than 10 years. Death is usually due to respiratory failure because of diminished strength in the skeletal muscles responsible for breathing. Few treatment options exist for these patients, resulting in a high unmet need for new therapies to address functional deficits and disease progression. About Tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 Tirasemtiv is a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (FSTA) that selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex by increasing its sensitivity to calcium and, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, demonstrated increases in skeletal muscle force in response to neuronal input and delays in the onset and reductions in the degree of muscle fatigue. Tirasemtiv has been studied in clinical trials that have enrolled over 1500 people internationally. CK-2127107 is a next-generation FSTA from Cytokinetics' skeletal muscle contractility program. CK-2127107 was derived from a different chemical structural class and was designed to have certain advantages relative to tirasemtiv . CK-2127107 appears to be more potent than tirasemtiv in preclinical models and in humans and appears better tolerated compared to tirasemtiv . CK-2127107 has demonstrated pharmacological activity that may lead to new therapeutic options for diseases associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. CK-2127107 has been the subject of five completed Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers, which evaluated the safety, tolerability, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug candidate. CK-2127107 is the subject of an ongoing clinical development program in neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular diseases and conditions associated with muscle dysfunction and weakness, including three Phase 2 trials currently underway in patients with each of SMA, ALS, or COPD, as well as a Phase 1b trial in elderly subjects with limited mobility. About Cytokinetics Cytokinetics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which muscle performance is compromised and/or declining.

In the final analysis of the study, there was an improvement in OS for patients treated with KEYTRUDA compared to placebo, however these OS results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.611-0.998]; p=0.0238). Results for PFS were also directionally favorable in the KEYTRUDA arm compared with placebo but did not reach statistical significance (HR=0.78 [95% CI, 0.61-0.99]; p=0.0209). The key secondary endpoint of objective response rate (ORR) was not formally tested, since superiority was not reached for OS or PFS. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and have been shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for discussion. “While we are disappointed KEYNOTE-240 did not meet its co-primary endpoints, the results for overall survival, progression-free survival and objective response rate are generally consistent with findings from the Phase 2 study, KEYNOTE-224, which led to the accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this study and are committed to helping patients diagnosed with this common and difficult-to-treat type of liver cancer.” KEYTRUDA is being studied across multiple settings and lines of therapy for HCC through our broad clinical program that includes 10 clinical trials sponsored by Merck or in collaborations. As monotherapy in second-line HCC, in addition to KEYNOTE-240 and KEYNOTE-224, KEYTRUDA is being investigated in the ongoing Phase 3, KEYNOTE-394 trial, a randomized, double-blind trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with best supportive care, compared to placebo in combination with best supportive care, in Asian patients with advanced HCC who were previously treated with systemic therapy. In addition, there are several ongoing trials investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with other treatments, including therapies through our collaborations. About KEYNOTE-240 KEYNOTE-240 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02702401 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus best supportive care compared to placebo plus best supportive care in patients with advanced HCC who were previously treated with systemic therapy. The primary endpoints are OS and PFS. The secondary endpoints include ORR, duration of response, disease control rate and time to progression. The study enrolled 413 patients who were randomized to receive either KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks for up to 35 cycles of treatment [up to approximately two years]) plus best supportive care (including pain management and management of other potential complications including ascites per local standards of care) or placebo plus best supportive care. About Hepatocellular Carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer in adults, which is the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide. Risk factors for liver cancer include gender, ethnicity, chronic viral hepatitis (Hep-B or Hep-C) infection, cirrhosis, alcohol use and metabolic syndrome. Hepatocellular carcinoma – which is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage – has one of the highest mortality rates of solid cancers, with a five-year survival rate of less than 15 percent. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 900 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%), and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC occurring in 15% (28/192) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 and withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials and postmarketing use. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions. In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HCC were generally similar to those in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy, with the exception of increased incidences of ascites (8% Grades 3-4) and immune-mediated hepatitis (2.9%). Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence were elevated AST (20%), ALT (9%), and hyperbilirubinemia (10%). Among the 50 patients with MCC enrolled in study KEYNOTE-017, adverse reactions occurring in patients with MCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy. Laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) that occurred at a higher incidence were elevated AST (11%) and hyperglycemia (19%). Lactation Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the final dose. Pediatric Use There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a trial, in 40 pediatric patients (16 children aged 2 years to younger than 12 years and 24 adolescents aged 12 years to 18 years) with various cancers, including unapproved usages, were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of 3 doses (range 1–17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving 2 doses or more. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults; adverse reactions that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), increased transaminases (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

The trial was conducted among 237 adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease progressed while on or after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitor immunotherapy 4 . Two Phase III CANOPY trials continue, evaluating canakinumab in first-line and adjuvant settings 2,3 . Novartis and CANOPY-2 investigators will analyze the study data and are expected to submit its findings for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting. “While results from the CANOPY-2 trial are not what we hoped for in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have been treated with other lines of therapy, these data give us valuable insights into IL-1β inhibition,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer at Novartis. “Ongoing Phase III studies in non-small cell lung cancer continue, evaluating canakinumab in earlier treatment settings. We sincerely thank the patients and clinical investigators involved in the CANOPY-2 study for their partnership.” CANOPY-1, a Phase III study evaluating canakinumab in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, is expected to report final results before the end of the year 2 . CANOPY-A, another Phase III study, is investigating canakinumab as an adjuvant therapy and has enrolled more than 950 patients to date and is expected to enroll a total of 1,500 patients 3 . About canakinumab (ACZ885) Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to human interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) 6 , 7 and neutralizes IL-1β activity by blocking its interaction with its receptors 8 . By neutralizing IL-1β, preliminary evidence suggests that canakinumab inhibits pro-tumor inflammation (PTI) to 1) enhance anti-tumor immune response; 2) reduce tumor cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness; and 3) impair angiogenesis 8 . Pro-tumor inflammation enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and by suppressing anti-tumor immune responses 9,10 . Canakinumab is a first-in-class interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) inhibitor of PTI in non-small cell lung cancer 10 . About the CANOPY program Novartis launched the CANOPY study program after observing significantly lower than expected rates of lung cancer mortality among patients in the Phase III cardiovascular CANTOS trial. The CANTOS trial evaluated canakinumab as a secondary prevention measure for cardiovascular events in patients following a heart attack (CRP≥2 mg/L) 8,9 . Patients in the CANTOS trial were also at high risk for inflammatory cancers, like lung cancer, due to advanced age, smoking history and other clinical risk factors 8,9 . Based on these findings, Novartis launched three, large-scale, randomized, Phase III clinical trials and a Phase II clinical trial to investigate canakinumab as a potential treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CANOPY-1 (NCT03631199) is a Phase III trial evaluating canakinumab as a first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy 2 CANOPY-2 (NCT03626545 ) is a Phase III trial investigating the role of canakinumab in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel in second- or third-line therapy versus docetaxel alone in NSCLC. Part 1 of the CANOPY-2 trial – a safety run-in study to determine the appropriate dosage, was previously presented at ASCO 2019. Part 2 of the trial, reported today, evaluated overall survival (OS) 4 CANOPY-A (NCT03447769) is a Phase III trial studying canakinumab in the adjuvant setting, following surgical resection and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The adjuvant study is designed to determine if treatment with canakinumab can prevent cancer relapse 3 CANOPY-N (NCT03968419) is a non-registrational Phase II neoadjuvant trial evaluating canakinumab in combination with pembrolizumab among patients with resectable NSCLC prior to their planned surgery 5 Novartis and Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for more than 2 million new cases diagnosed each year 1 1 . There are two main types of lung cancer – small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 1 2 . NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses, resulting in nearly 1.7 million new cases each year 11 , 1 3 . Currently, the five-year survival rate for lung cancer is less than 20% 1 4 , decreasing further when the disease is diagnosed at later stages 1 5 . The majority of people with NSCLC are diagnosed with advanced or Stage III or IV disease 1 6 , and treatment options are limited for people with lung cancer who experience cancer growth or progression while on standard of care treatments 1 7 - 19 . More people die of lung cancer every year than any other cancer type 11 . Novartis is committed to developing best-in-class treatments for lung cancer patients around the world. With a focus on both targeted, personalized medicine and the role of newer, immuno-oncology therapies, the lung cancer drug development program at Novartis is among the most robust in the industry. With research activities informed by long-term relationships with leading lung cancer thought leaders and patient advocates, Novartis is focused on reimagining the treatment of lung cancer.

Initial data show there was no statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients on ruxolitinib plus SoC therapy who experienced severe complications, including death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) by Day 29, compared to SoC alone 1 . The trial also did not show clinically relevant benefit among secondary and exploratory endpoints including mortality rate by Day 29, and time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations) 1 . “While the RUXCOVID trial did not give us the results we hoped for, we will continue working with the medical community to analyze its findings to better understand COVID-19 and the role of JAK inhibition,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “We would like to thank the front-line clinical teams and staff at each of the trial sites and the hundreds of patients who volunteered to participate and their loved ones. We are deeply grateful to them and will continue our dedicated scientific research into the ongoing global pandemic.” In the trial, the proportion of patients who died, or required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure or ICU care by Day 29, the primary endpoint, was 12.0% for ruxolitinib plus SoC vs. 11.8% for placebo plus SoC (OR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.48-1.73]; p=0.769) 1 . Ruxolitinib was generally well-tolerated, and a comprehensive analysis including safety data is ongoing 1 . The results of RUXCOVID do not affect any ongoing trials for ruxolitinib in non-COVID-19 diseases. About RUXCOVID RUXCOVID (NCT04362137) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care (SoC) therapy compared to placebo plus SoC therapy in patients aged ≥12 years hospitalized for COVID-19 and not intubated or receiving ICU care prior to randomization. The study has enrolled 432 patients globally 2 . The composite primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who die, develop respiratory failure (require mechanical ventilation), or require admission to ICU by Day 29. Secondary endpoints include various efficacy assessments including evaluation of clinical status using a 9-point ordinal scale; in-hospital outcomes (mortality rate; proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation; duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation); change in the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2); change in SpO2/FiO2 ratio; proportion of patients with no oxygen therapy (oxygen saturation of ≥94% on room air); and safety. The exploratory endpoint of time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations) was also evaluated 2 . Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive oral ruxolitinib 5mg twice daily (BID) or oral-matching placebo for a total of 14 days. Study treatment is given in combination with SoC therapy according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. After 14 days of therapy, should clinical signs or symptoms not improve or worsen, and the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks, patients may receive an additional 14 days of study therapy. In total, patients are followed on study for 29 days post-randomization 2 . RUXCOVID is sponsored by Novartis outside of the US and by Incyte in the US. About ruxolitinib Ruxolitinib is an oral inhibitor of the JAK 1 and JAK 2 tyrosine kinases. It is approved under the trade name Jakavi ® in Europe and other regions and countries for the treatment of adult patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea and for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF), also known as chronic idiopathic MF, post-polycythemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythemia MF. Approved indications vary by country 3 . The safety and efficacy profile of Jakavi has not yet been established outside of its approved indications. Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation for development and commercialization outside the US. Ruxolitinib is marketed outside the US by Novartis as Jakavi ® , and in the US by Incyte Corporation as Jakafi ® for patients with PV who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, for patients with intermediate or high-risk MF, and steroid-refractory acute GvHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older 3 . Jakavi is a registered trademark of Novartis AG in countries outside the US. Jakafi is a registered trademark of Incyte Corporation. Novartis response to COVID-19 pandemic Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) 4 . Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin ® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19 5 , and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-19 6,7 . In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low-and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia 4 . Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID 8 .

The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority in progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS 22.3 months for KMP versus 22.1 months for VMP, HR = 0.91, 95 percent CI, 0.75 - 1.10). While the data for overall survival, a secondary endpoint, are not yet mature, the observed hazard ratio (KMP versus VMP) was 1.21 (95 percent CI, 0.90 - 1.64). Neither result was statistically significant. Overall, the adverse events in the KMP arm were consistent with the known safety profile of KYPROLIS. The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse events was 74.7 percent in the KMP arm and 76.2 percent in the VMP arm. Fatal treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 6.5 percent of KMP patients and 4.3 percent of VMP patients. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, a secondary endpoint, was 2.5 percent in the KMP arm and 35.1 percent in the VMP arm. These data will be submitted to a future medical conference and for publication. ""Based on studies in the KYPROLIS label, including the ENDEAVOR study, a head-to-head comparison of KYPROLIS to Velcade in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, we know KYPROLIS to be a major advance in proteasome inhibitor therapy,"" said Sean E. Harper , M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen . ""The CLARION results, generated in the context of a melphalan-containing regimen, are disappointing, especially given the robust data we've seen in the second-line setting. However, the myeloma landscape has changed dramatically since the design of the CLARION study with very few newly diagnosed patients treated with melphalan-based regimens, particularly in the U.S.  We remain committed to exploring KYPROLIS in combination with other agents to advance the treatment of multiple myeloma."" Amgen supports a number of investigator-sponsored studies, and a Phase 3 study evaluating KYPROLIS in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (KRd) versus Velcade in combination with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (VRd) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. This trial, called E1A11 or ENDURANCE, is underway independently by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group with funding provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and its National Clinical Trials Network. Over 750 institutions nationwide are currently enrolling patients in the study (NCT01863550). The KYPROLIS clinical program continues to focus on providing solutions for physicians and patients in treating this frequently relapsing and difficult-to-treat cancer. KYPROLIS is available for patients whose myeloma has relapsed or become resistant to another treatment and continues to be studied in a range of combinations and patient populations. About the CLARION Study The CLARION study was a Phase 3 head-to-head multicenter, open-label, randomized study in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. A total of 955 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive KYPROLIS, melphalan and prednisone or Velcade, melphalan and prednisone for 54 weeks.  The median patient age was 72. The KMP regimen consisted of KYPROLIS as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 22, 23, 29 and 30 during each 42-day cycle (20 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1; 36 mg/m 2 thereafter), melphalan 9 mg/m 2 on days 1–4, and prednisone 60 mg/m 2 on days 1–4.

About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer, characterized by a recurring pattern of remission and relapse. 1 It is a rare and very aggressive disease that accounts for approximately one percent of all cancers. 2,3 In the U.S., there are nearly 95,000 people living with, or in remission from, multiple myeloma. 4 Approximately 30,330 Americans are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year and 12,650 patient deaths are reported on an annual basis. 4 About Amgen's Commitment to Oncology Amgen Oncology is committed to helping patients take on some of the toughest cancers, such as those that have been resistant to drugs, those that progress rapidly through the body and those where limited treatment options exist. Amgen's supportive care treatments help patients combat certain side effects of strong chemotherapy, and our targeted medicines and immunotherapies focus on more than a dozen different malignancies, ranging from blood cancers to solid tumors. With decades of experience providing therapies for cancer patients, Amgen continues to grow its portfolio of innovative and biosimilar oncology medicines. About KYPROLIS ® (carfilzomib) Proteasomes play an important role in cell function and growth by breaking down proteins that are damaged or no longer needed. 5 KYPROLIS has been shown to block proteasomes, leading to an excessive build-up of proteins within cells. 5 In some cells, KYPROLIS can cause cell death, especially in myeloma cells because they are more likely to contain a higher amount of abnormal proteins. 5,6 KYPROLIS is approved in the U.S. for the following: In combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy. As a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy. KYPROLIS is also approved in Argentina , Israel , Kuwait , Mexico , Thailand , Colombia , Korea , Canada , Switzerland , Russia , Brazil and the European Union . Additional regulatory applications for KYPROLIS are underway and have been submitted to health authorities worldwide. For more U.S. information, please visit www.kyprolis.com . IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Cardiac Toxicities New onset or worsening of pre-existing cardiac failure (e.g., congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, decreased ejection fraction), restrictive cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction including fatalities have occurred following administration of KYPROLIS. Some events occurred in patients with normal baseline ventricular function. Death due to cardiac arrest has occurred within one day of KYPROLIS administration. Monitor patients for clinical signs or symptoms of cardiac failure or cardiac ischemia. Evaluate promptly if cardiac toxicity is suspected. Withhold KYPROLIS for Grade 3 or 4 cardiac adverse events until recovery, and consider whether to restart KYPROLIS at 1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk assessment. While adequate hydration is required prior to each dose in Cycle 1, monitor all patients for evidence of volume overload, especially patients at risk for cardiac failure. Adjust total fluid intake as clinically appropriate in patients with baseline cardiac failure or who are at risk for cardiac failure. Patients ≥ 75 years, the risk of cardiac failure is increased. Patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, conduction abnormalities, angina, or arrhythmias may be at greater risk for cardiac complications and should have a comprehensive medical assessment (including blood pressure and fluid management) prior to starting treatment with KYPROLIS and remain under close follow-up. Acute Renal Failure Cases of acute renal failure and renal insufficiency adverse events (including renal failure) have occurred in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Acute renal failure was reported more frequently in patients with advanced relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received KYPROLIS monotherapy. Monitor renal function with regular measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine clearance. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Cases of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), including fatal outcomes, have occurred in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Patients with multiple myeloma and a high tumor burden should be considered at greater risk for TLS. Adequate hydration is required prior to each dose in Cycle 1, and in subsequent cycles as needed. Consider uric acid lowering drugs in patients at risk for TLS. Monitor for evidence of TLS during treatment and manage promptly. Withhold KYPROLIS until TLS is resolved. Pulmonary Toxicity Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease such as pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease have occurred in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Some events have been fatal. In the event of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity, discontinue KYPROLIS. Pulmonary Hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was reported in patients treated with KYPROLIS. Evaluate with cardiac imaging and/or other tests as indicated. Withhold KYPROLIS for PAH until resolved or returned to baseline and consider whether to restart KYPROLIS based on a benefit/risk assessment. Dyspnea Dyspnea was reported in patients treated with KYPROLIS. Evaluate dyspnea to exclude cardiopulmonary conditions including cardiac failure and pulmonary syndromes. Stop KYPROLIS for Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea until resolved or returned to baseline. Consider whether to restart KYPROLIS based on a benefit/risk assessment. Hypertension Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency, has been observed with KYPROLIS. Some of these events have been fatal. Monitor blood pressure regularly in all patients. If hypertension cannot be adequately controlled, withhold KYPROLIS and evaluate. Consider whether to restart KYPROLIS based on a benefit/risk assessment. Venous Thrombosis Venous thromboembolic events (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) have been observed with KYPROLIS. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for patients being treated with the combination of KYPROLIS with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. The thromboprophylaxis regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks. Patients using oral contraceptives or a hormonal method of contraception associated with a risk of thrombosis should consider an alternative method of effective contraception during treatment with KYPROLIS in combination with dexamethasone or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions, including life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Symptoms include fever, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial edema, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina. These reactions can occur immediately following or up to 24 hours after administration of KYPROLIS. Premedicate with dexamethasone to reduce the incidence and severity of infusion reactions. Inform patients of the risk and of symptoms of an infusion reaction and to contact a physician immediately if they occur. Hemorrhage Fatal or serious cases of hemorrhage have been reported in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Hemorrhagic events have included gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and intracranial hemorrhage and epistaxis. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate. Thrombocytopenia KYPROLIS causes thrombocytopenia with recovery to baseline platelet count usually by the start of the next cycle. Thrombocytopenia was reported in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Monitor platelet counts frequently during treatment with KYPROLIS. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate. Hepatic Toxicity and Hepatic Failure Cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported during treatment with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS can cause increased serum transaminases. Monitor liver enzymes regularly regardless of baseline values. Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate. Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), including fatal outcome have occurred in patients receiving KYPROLIS. Monitor for signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS. Discontinue KYPROLIS if diagnosis is suspected. If the diagnosis of TTP/HUS is excluded, KYPROLIS may be restarted. The safety of reinitiating KYPROLIS therapy in patients previously experiencing TTP/HUS is not known. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Cases of PRES have occurred in patients receiving KYPROLIS. PRES was formerly known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome. Consider a neuro-radiological imaging (MRI) for onset of visual or neurological symptoms. Discontinue KYPROLIS if PRES is suspected and evaluate. The safety of reinitiating KYPROLIS therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known. Embryo-fetal Toxicity KYPROLIS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with KYPROLIS. Males of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid fathering a child while being treated with KYPROLIS. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients treated with KYPROLIS in the combination therapy trials: anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, insomnia, muscle spasm, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, hypokalemia. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients treated with KYPROLIS in monotherapy trials: anemia, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, nausea, pyrexia, dyspnea, diarrhea, headache, cough, edema peripheral.

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project.  Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced first-time data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-598 study evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy ® ) compared with KEYTRUDA monotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and whose tumors express PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] ≥50%). Results of the study showed that the addition of ipilimumab to KEYTRUDA did not improve overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) but added toxicity compared with KEYTRUDA monotherapy in these patients. The median OS was 21.4 months for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab versus 21.9 months for those randomized to KEYTRUDA monotherapy (HR=1.08 [95% CI, 0.85-1.37]; p=0.74). Additionally, the median PFS was 8.2 months for patients in the combination arm versus 8.4 months for those in the KEYTRUDA monotherapy arm (HR=1.06 [95% CI, 0.86-1.30]; p=0.72). “In KEYNOTE-598, the addition of ipilimumab to KEYTRUDA did not improve overall survival or progression-free survival, and patients who received the combination were more likely to experience serious side effects than those who received KEYTRUDA monotherapy,” said Dr. Michael Boyer, chief clinical officer and conjoint chair of thoracic oncology, Chris O’Brien Lifehouse, Camperdown, NSW, Australia. “KEYTRUDA monotherapy remains a standard of care for the first-line treatment of certain patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PD-L1.” “As a leader in lung cancer, we are pursuing a broad clinical program to better understand the potential of KEYTRUDA-based combinations to improve survival outcomes for patients with this devastating disease,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “KEYNOTE-598 is the first head-to-head study designed to answer the question of whether combining KEYTRUDA with ipilimumab provided additional clinical benefits beyond treatment with KEYTRUDA alone in certain patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The results are clear – the combination did not add clinical benefit but did add toxicity.” These results were presented in the Presidential Symposium at the IASLC 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer on Friday, Jan. 29 and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . As previously announced in Nov. 2020, the study was discontinued due to futility based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), which determined the benefit/risk profile of KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab did not support continuing the trial. The DMC also advised that patients in the study discontinue treatment with ipilimumab/placebo. KEYNOTE-598 Study Design and Additional Data (Late-Breaking Abstract #PS01.09) KEYNOTE-598 ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03302234 ) is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab compared to KEYTRUDA monotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥50%). The dual primary endpoints are OS and PFS. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) and safety. The study enrolled 568 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles) in combination with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each six-week cycle for up to 18 cycles); or KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles) as monotherapy. Non-binding futility criteria for the study were based on restricted mean survival time (RMST), an alternative outcome measure estimated as the area under the survival curve through a fixed timepoint. The pre-specified criteria were differences in RMST for KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab and KEYTRUDA monotherapy of ≤0.2 at the maximum observation time and ≤0.1 at 24 months of follow-up. As of data cut-off, the median study follow-up was 20.6 months. Findings showed the median OS was 21.4 months for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab (n=284) versus 21.9 months for those randomized to KEYTRUDA monotherapy (n=284) (HR=1.08 [95% CI, 0.85-1.37]; p=0.74). The differences in RMST for KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab and KEYTRUDA monotherapy were -0.56 at the maximum observation time and -0.52 at 24 months, meeting the futility criteria for the trial and confirming the benefit/risk profile of the combination did not support continuing the study. Additionally, the median PFS was 8.2 months for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab versus 8.4 months for those randomized to KEYTRUDA monotherapy (HR=1.06 [95% CI, 0.86-1.30]; p=0.72). In both arms of the study, ORR was 45.4%; the median DOR was 16.1 months for patients randomized to KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab versus 17.3 months for those randomized to KEYTRUDA monotherapy. No new safety signals for KEYTRUDA monotherapy were observed. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 76.2% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab versus 68.3% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Of these TRAEs, 35.1% vs. 19.6% were Grade 3-5, 27.7% vs. 13.9% were serious, 6.0% vs. 3.2% led to discontinuation of ipilimumab or placebo, 19.1% vs. 7.5% led to discontinuation of both drugs and 2.5% vs. 0.0% (no patients) led to death. Additionally, immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) and infusion reactions occurred in 44.7% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with ipilimumab versus 32.4% of patients treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Of these immune-mediated AEs, 20.2% vs. 7.8% were Grade 3-5, 19.1% vs. 7.1% were serious, 1.8% vs. 1.1% led to discontinuation of ipilimumab or placebo, 12.1% vs. 4.3% led to discontinuation of both drugs and 2.1% vs. 0.0% (no patients) led to death. About Lung Cancer Lung cancer, which forms in the tissues of the lungs, usually within cells lining the air passages, is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than die of colon and breast cancers combined. The two main types of lung cancer are non-small cell and small cell. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all cases. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. Before 2014, the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with NSCLC and SCLC was estimated to be 5% and 6%, respectively. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,300 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA with Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

During the study, natalizumab was generally well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with its known safety profile. ASCEND evaluated the efficacy and safety of natalizumab to slow the accumulation of disability progression unrelated to relapse in SPMS patients, an unmet medical need. The majority of study participants had EDSS scores of 6.0 to 6.5 (walking aid required) and were non-relapsing for two years prior to enrollment in the study. The study’s composite primary endpoint evaluated the percentage of patients whose disability had progressed on one or more of three disability measurements comprising the composite endpoint. Natalizumab demonstrated a statistically significant effect on upper limb function (one of the three components of the primary composite endpoint) unrelated to relapses. Consistent with the established effects of natalizumab in relapsing multiple sclerosis, analyses of exploratory endpoints suggest that some patients received a benefit from treatment, including reduction of relapses and new MRI lesions. “While we’re disappointed with these results, we believe this research will provide the MS community important insights into this more advanced patient population, and the benefits that natalizumab may provide in areas such as upper limb function,” said Alfred Sandrock, M.D., Ph.D., group senior vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen. “Given the challenges of treating this advanced stage of MS, these results underscore the importance of treatment early in the course of disease with effective disease-modifying therapies before a patient advances to SPMS.” SPMS is characterized by ongoing nerve damage or loss and patients experience disability progression with increasingly less frequent relapses. Despite extensive clinical research, treatment options for patients with SPMS are extremely limited and none have demonstrated efficacy in slowing the progression of disability unrelated to relapse. Natalizumab is a high-efficacy treatment for patients with relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing-remitting MS. The safety and efficacy of natalizumab has been established across a robust clinical program and real-world use with more than a decade of clinical experience demonstrating its benefits on disease progression and sustained efficacy in relapsing MS with a well-characterized safety profile. Detailed results from ASCEND will be presented at a future medical conference. About ASCEND ASCEND (A Study to Characterize the Efficacy of Natalizumab on Disability in SPMS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial involving 889 patients in 15 countries. Participants were randomized to receive either natalizumab 300 mg or placebo intravenously every four weeks for 96 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was the percentage of patients with confirmed progression of disability on one or more components of ASCEND’s composite endpoint : the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) where progression was confirmed at a second visit at least 6 months later and at week 96. About TYSABRI ® (natalizumab) TYSABRI is a DMT approved in more than 65 countries. In the United States, TYSABRI is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS. In the European Union, it is indicated as a single DMT in highly active relapsing-remitting MS for adult patients who have high disease activity despite treatment with a beta interferon or glatiramer acetate or patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS. TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral infection of the brain which usually leads to death or severe disability. Risk factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. TYSABRI increases the risk of developing encephalitis and meningitis caused by herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses. Serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal cases have been reported in the postmarketing setting in multiple sclerosis patients receiving TYSABRI. Clinically significant liver injury has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. Other serious adverse events that have occurred in TYSABRI-treated patients include hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and infections, including opportunistic and other atypical infections. TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its proven ability to slow the progression of disability, reduce relapse rates, and impact the number of MRI brain lesions with a well-characterized safety profile. Data from the Phase 3 AFFIRM trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine , showed that at two years, TYSABRI treatment led to a 67 percent relative reduction (p<0.001) in the annualized relapse rate when compared with placebo and reduced the relative risk of disability progression by 42 percent (p<0.001). TYSABRI is a monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to α4-integrin and is thought to interrupt the activity of inflammatory cells in MS patients by blocking the interaction between α4β1-integrin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Disruption of these molecular interactions prevents transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue. The specific mechanism(s) by which TYSABRI exerts its effects in multiple sclerosis have not been fully defined.

( NASDAQ : REGN ) today announced topline results from the Phase 2 CAPELLA study evaluating aflibercept co-formulated with rinucumab, an anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (anti-PDGFR-beta) antibody, in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). The combination therapy did not demonstrate an improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to intravitreal aflibercept injection monotherapy at 12 weeks, the primary endpoint of the study. At 12 weeks, patients in both combination aflibercept/rinucumab groups showed a 5.8 letter improvement in BCVA. Patients treated with aflibercept alone showed a 7.5 letter improvement in BCVA. ""EYLEA ® (aflibercept) injection is an established, effective therapy that has set a high bar in the treatment of wet AMD,"" said George D. Yancopoulos M.D ., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron and President of Regeneron Laboratories . ""The addition of rinucumab did not improve on the efficacy of aflibercept alone. We are committed to continuing to innovate for patients with serious vision-threatening diseases, and look forward to the results of our ongoing combination studies of aflibercept and nesvacumab, an anti-angiopoietin 2 antibody, for which the preclinical data is more supportive."" EYLEA results in this study were consistent with the efficacy and safety seen in Phase 3 pivotal studies in wet AMD. The efficacy results in the CAPELLA trial were consistent across all choroidal neovascularization (CNV) subtypes. Adding rinucumab to aflibercept showed no benefit on anatomic endpoints including reduction in retinal thickness or in resolution of subretinal hyper-reflective material. Ocular adverse events at 12 weeks were more common in the combination treatment groups (23.5 and 20 percent) compared to aflibercept alone (16 percent), primarily driven by an increase in conjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation and eye pain. The ongoing Phase 2, double-masked, randomized, controlled, multiple-dose, regimen-ranging study has enrolled approximately 500 patients with wet AMD. Efficacy was evaluated using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS) BCVA. Patients were randomized into one of three groups and received fixed doses every four weeks of either aflibercept monotherapy 2mg, aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 1mg or aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 3mg. The co-formulation was administered as a single intravitreal injection. At week 12, two of the three treatment groups were re-randomized, resulting in five total dosing groups in the second phase of the study. Data will be evaluated at 28 weeks and again at 52 weeks, when the study is completed. More detailed results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical congress.

The 48-week trial assessed the efficacy and safety of the potential new medicine tezepelumab compared to placebo in 150 severe asthma patients who required maintenance use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) on top of standard of care (SoC). Tezepelumab's effect on other efficacy parameters was similar to those observed in previous studies, including the registrational Phase 3 NAVIGATOR study. Further analyses of the data are ongoing. The safety profile of tezepelumab in the trial was consistent with previous trials. Detailed results from the SOURCE trial will be presented at a future medical meeting. ""The recent results from our NAVIGATOR trial were impressive, both in terms of the overall clinical data and the reduction in exacerbation rate with tezepelumab treatment, and we continue to work with AstraZeneca on planned regulatory filings in 2021. While the SOURCE results were surprising, they provide important insights into the use of oral corticosteroids and the patients who are receiving them, which we look forward to exploring further,"" said David M. Reese , M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen . ""On initial review, the study design may have contributed to the results observed on the primary endpoint."" On November 10 th , 2020, AstraZeneca and Amgen announced positive results from the NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial which met the primary endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) in a broad population of patients with severe asthma, including those with low levels of eosinophils. Tezepelumab is a potential first-in-class medicine that blocks the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), an epithelial derived cytokine that plays a key role across the spectrum of asthma inflammation. 2,3 Severe asthma is a complex, heterogenous disease and many patients continue to face debilitating symptoms despite receiving standard of care inhaled medicines and currently approved biologics. 5-8 In September 2018 , the US Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab in patients with severe asthma, without an eosinophilic phenotype. 4 Tezepelumab is being developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Amgen (see AstraZeneca and Amgen collaboration below). Amgen and AstraZeneca Collaboration Earlier in 2020, Amgen and AstraZeneca updated the 2012 collaboration agreement for tezepelumab. Both companies will continue to share costs and profits equally after payment by AstraZeneca of a mid-single-digit royalty to Amgen . AstraZeneca continues to lead development and Amgen continues to lead manufacturing. All aspects of the collaboration are under the oversight of joint governing bodies. Under the amended agreement in North America , Amgen and AstraZeneca will jointly commercialize tezepelumab. Amgen will record sales in the U.S. and AstraZeneca will record sales in Canada . Outside the U.S. , Amgen will record sales as collaboration revenue. About Tezepelumab Tezepelumab is an investigational, potential first-in-class human monoclonal antibody that works on the primary source of inflammation: the airway epithelium, which is the first point of contact for viruses, allergens, pollutants, and other environmental insults. Specifically, tezepelumab targets and blocks TSLP, a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and initiates an overreactive immune response to allergic, eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma. 2,3,12 TSLP is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations, including allergens, viruses and other airborne particles. 2,3 Expression of TSLP is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity. 3,12 Blocking TSLP may prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells, resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control. 3,12 By working at the top of the cascade, tezepelumab helps stop inflammation at the source and has the potential to treat a broad population of severe asthma patients. 3,12 PATHFINDER Clinical Trial Program Building on the positive Phase 2b PATHWAY trial, the Phase 3 PATHFINDER program included two trials, the registrational NAVIGATOR study and SOURCE. 12-15 The program includes additional planned mechanistic and long-term safety trials. SOURCE is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial for 48 weeks in adult patients with severe asthma who require continuous treatment with ICS plus long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), and chronic treatment with maintenance OCS therapy. 13 In the trial, patients were randomized to receive tezepelumab 210mg every four weeks or placebo as add-on therapy, with patients maintained on their currently prescribed ICS plus LABA, with or without other asthma controller therapy. 13 The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage reduction from baseline in the prescribed daily OCS maintenance dose at 48 weeks while not losing asthma control. Secondary endpoints included the effect of tezepelumab on annualized asthma exacerbation rate, lung function, asthma control, quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment. The SOURCE trial population included approximately 35% of subjects with high (≥ 300 cells/µL) and 65% with low (<300 cells/µL) blood eosinophil counts. 13 Patient's OCS dose was optimized during an 8-week optimization period. For the first eight  weeks of the 48-week treatment period, patients remained on their optimized OCS dose. OCS dose reduction was started at week four, with the possibility of a dose reduction every 4 weeks if asthma control was maintained up until week 40. From week 40 onwards, patients remained on the OCS dose reached at week 40 (or earlier if the OCS dose reduction failed because of clinical deterioration) or remained on complete OCS elimination if possible. 13 NAVIGATOR is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 1,061 adults (18–80 years old) and adolescents (12–17 years old) with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were receiving treatment with medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS. NAVIGATOR met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care (SoC) demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks in the overall patient population, compared to placebo added to SoC. The trial also met the primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 300 cells per microliter, with tezepelumab demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in AAER in that patient population. Similar reductions in AAER were observed in the subgroup of patients with baseline eosinophil counts less than 150 cells per microliter. 15 Patients who participated in the NAVIGATOR and SOURCE trials were eligible to continue in DESTINATION, a Phase 3 extension trial assessing long term safety and efficacy. 16 Amgen Inflammation Amgen brings therapies to millions of people with inflammatory diseases, with a focus on serving unmet patient needs.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen , including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for Amgen to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints Amgen has selected. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products, including its devices, after they are on the market. Amgen 's results may be affected by its ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of Amgen 's products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, Amgen 's research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Amgen 's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, Amgen 's business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while Amgen routinely obtains patents for its products and technology, the protection offered by its patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors, or Amgen may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. Amgen performs a substantial amount of its commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico , and also depends on third parties for a portion of its manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials  for Amgen 's manufacturing  activities,  the  distribution  of Amgen 's products,  the commercialization of Amgen 's product candidates, and Amgen 's clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on Amgen 's product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Amgen relies on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of its product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of its commercial products. In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to many of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for Amgen 's products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of Amgen 's distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with Amgen . The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen 's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on its business and results of operations. Amgen 's efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology Amgen has acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Amgen 's systems and Amgen 's data. Amgen 's stock price may be volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Amgen 's business performance could affect or limit the ability of the Amgen Board of Directors to declare a dividend or its ability to pay a dividend or repurchase its common stock. Amgen may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to it, or at all.

No new safety or tolerability findings related to tirasemtiv were identified in VITALITY-ALS.  Serious adverse events were similar between patients who received tirasemtiv or placebo but more patients discontinued double-blind treatment on tirasemtiv than on placebo primarily due to non-serious adverse events related to tolerability. The decline in SVC from baseline to 24 weeks was smaller in patients who received any dose of tirasemtiv in VITALITY-ALS compared to the decline in patients receiving placebo.  The largest differences from placebo were observed in patients randomized to the mid- and high-dose groups of tirasemtiv who could tolerate and remain on their target dose, although those differences were not statistically significant. “While we are deeply disappointed by the results of VITALITY-ALS, we remain committed to people with ALS who are fighting this devastating disease and who need new therapies to slow the decline of respiratory function and muscle strength that are key hallmarks of disease progression,” said Robert I. Blum , Cytokinetics’ President and CEO. “We have decided to suspend the development of tirasemtiv . While we believe that VITALITY-ALS demonstrated pharmacologic activity for the mechanism of action, we also believe that limitations of tirasemtiv may be addressed with our next-generation fast skeletal muscle activator, CK-2127107.  Based on previous Phase 1 clinical studies, we believe CK-2127107 will be better tolerated and potentially more effective than tirasemtiv in patients with ALS and look forward to Phase 2 trial results in 2018. We are grateful to the trial investigators, site personnel, patients and caregivers who participated in VITALITY-ALS.” The results of VITALITY-ALS will be presented on December 8, 2017 at the 27th Annual International ALS/MND Symposium in Boston, MA by Jeremy Shefner , M.D., Ph.D., Lead Investigator of VITALITY-ALS, Professor and Chair of Neurology at Barrow Neurological Institute , and Professor and Executive Chair of Neurology at University of Arizona , Phoenix . About VITALITY-ALS and VIGOR-ALS VITALITY-ALS was a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with possible, probable or definite ALS, diagnosed within 24 months, and with SVC at baseline ≥ 70 percent predicted. The primary endpoint of the trial assessed change from baseline in SVC, after 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment. Secondary endpoints, assessed at 48 weeks, included change from baseline in the score of the three respiratory items of the ALSFRS-R (i.e., the sum of items 10, 11 and 12) at 48 weeks; slope of the mega-score of muscle strength at 48 weeks; time to the first occurrence of a decline from baseline in percent predicted SVC ≥20 percentage points or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or death through 48 weeks; time to the first occurrence of a decline in SVC to ≤50% predicted or the onset of respiratory insufficiency or death through 48 weeks; change from baseline in the ALSFRS-R total score at 48 weeks; and time to the first use of mechanical ventilatory assistance or death through 48 weeks. Patients enrolled in VITALITY-ALS received two-weeks of open-label treatment with tirasemtiv administered at 250 mg/day. Patients were then randomized into a double-blind treatment phase to placebo or one of three target tirasemtiv dose levels (250 mg/day, 375 mg/day, 500 mg/day) in a 3:2:2:2 ratio. After 48 weeks of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment, patients who received tirasemtiv during those 48 weeks of double-blind treatment were randomized to continue the dose of tirasemtiv at which they completed the 48 weeks of double-blind treatment or to placebo for a four-week double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase.  Patients who received placebo during the 48 weeks of double-blind treatment continued to receive placebo during the double-blind, tirasemtiv withdrawal phase. Following their participation in VITALITY-ALS, patients were eligible to participate in an open-label extension study of tirasemtiv, VIGOR-ALS ( V entilatory I nvestigations in G lobal O pen-label R esearch in ALS ), designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of tirasemtiv in patients with ALS. Currently, over 200 patients are receiving tirasemtiv in VIGOR-ALS. Cytokinetics will seek advice from the academic leadership of VITALITY-ALS and its clinical investigators, regulatory authorities and other consultants before making decisions about continuing treatment with tirasemtiv in VIGOR-ALS. About ALS Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that afflicts approximately 30,000 people in the United States and a comparable number of patients in Europe . Approximately 6,000 new cases of ALS are diagnosed each year in the United States . The average life expectancy of an ALS patient is approximately three to five years after diagnosis and only 10 percent of patients survive for more than 10 years. Death is usually due to respiratory failure because of diminished strength in the skeletal muscles responsible for breathing. Few treatment options exist for these patients, resulting in a high unmet need for new therapies to address functional deficits and disease progression. About Tirasemtiv and CK-2127107 Tirasemtiv is a fast skeletal muscle troponin activator (FSTA) that selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex by increasing its sensitivity to calcium and, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, demonstrated increases in skeletal muscle force in response to neuronal input and delays in the onset and reductions in the degree of muscle fatigue. Tirasemtiv has been studied in clinical trials that have enrolled over 1000 people internationally. CK-2127107 is a next-generation FSTA arising from Cytokinetics' skeletal muscle contractility program. CK-2127107 was derived from a different chemical structural class and was designed to have certain advantages relative to tirasemtiv .  CK-2127107 appears to be more potent than tirasemtiv in preclinical models and in humans and appears better tolerated compared to tirasemtiv .  CK-2127107 has demonstrated pharmacological activity that may lead to new therapeutic options for diseases associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. CK-2127107 has been the subject of five completed Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers, which evaluated the safety, tolerability, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug candidate. CK-2127107 is the subject of an ongoing clinical development program in neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular diseases and conditions associated with muscle dysfunction and weakness, including three Phase 2 trials currently underway in patients with each of SMA, ALS, or COPD, as well as a Phase 1b trial in elderly subjects with limited mobility.

The safety findings were consistent with the known profile of sorafenib.  Data from this study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific congress. ""While the primary endpoint of this adjuvant trial was not met, Bayer and Onyx remain dedicated to ongoing research in all stages of liver cancer,"" said Pamela A. Cyrus , M.D., Vice President and Head of U.S. Medical Affairs, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals .  ""The outcome announced today does not affect the currently approved indications. NEXAVAR is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer."" Full prescribing information for NEXAVAR is available at www.NEXAVAR-us.com . About the STORM Trial The Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled STORM ( S orafenib as Adjuvant T reatment in the Prevention o f R ecurrence of Hepatocellular Carcino m a) trial is an international multicenter study that evaluated clinical benefit of sorafenib versus placebo as an adjuvant treatment in patients with HCC following potential curative treatment (surgical resection or local ablation).  The primary endpoint of the study was recurrence-free survival (i.e., the length of time that a patient survives without recurrence of HCC).  Secondary endpoints included time to recurrence of HCC (intrahepatic and extrahepatic) and overall survival.  Safety and tolerability were also assessed. The trial included approximately 1,100 patients who were randomized to receive 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily or matching placebo for four years or until disease recurrence, whichever occurred first. About Liver Cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and is responsible for about 80 percent of the primary malignant liver tumors in adults. 1,2 Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world and is the second most common cause of death from cancer worldwide.  More than 780,000 cases of liver cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year (more than 395,000 in China , 52,000 in the European Union and 30,000 in the United States ) and the incidence is increasing.  In 2012, approximately 746,000 people died of liver cancer including approximately 383,000 in China , 48,000 in the European Union and 24,000 in the United States . 3 About NEXAVAR ® (sorafenib) Tablets NEXAVAR is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid carcinoma refractory to radioactive iodine treatment. NEXAVAR is thought to inhibit both the tumor cell and tumor vasculature. In in vitro studies, NEXAVAR has been shown to inhibit multiple kinases thought to be involved in both cell proliferation (growth) and angiogenesis (blood supply) – two important processes that enable cancer growth. These kinases include Raf kinase, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-B, KIT, FLT-3 and RET. NEXAVAR is currently approved in more than 100 countries. NEXAVAR is also being evaluated by Bayer and Onyx, international study groups, government agencies and individual investigators in a range of cancers. NEXAVAR is co-developed by Onyx and Bayer, except in Japan where Bayer manages all development. The companies co-promote NEXAVAR in the U.S. Outside of the U.S. Bayer has exclusive marketing rights, and Bayer and Onyx share profits globally, excluding Japan . Important Safety Considerations For NEXAVAR® (sorafenib) Tablets NEXAVAR in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is contraindicated in patients with squamous cell lung cancer. Cardiac ischemia and/or myocardial infarction may occur. The incidence of cardiac ischemia/infarction in NEXAVAR-treated vs. placebo-treated patients was 2.7% vs. 1.3%, 2.9% vs. 0.4%, and 1.9% vs. 0% in the HCC, RCC, and DTC studies, respectively. Temporary or permanent discontinuation of NEXAVAR should be considered in patients who develop cardiac ischemia and/or myocardial infarction. An increased risk of bleeding may occur following NEXAVAR administration. The following bleeding adverse reactions were reported in the NEXAVAR-treated vs. placebo-treated patients, respectively, in the HCC study: bleeding from esophageal varices (2.4% vs. 4%) and bleeding with fatal outcome at any site (2.4% vs. 4%); in the RCC study: bleeding regardless of causality (15.3% vs. 8.2%), Grade 3 bleeding  (2.0% vs. 1.3%), Grade 4 bleeding (0% vs. 0.2%), and one fatal hemorrhage in each treatment group; in the DTC study: bleeding (17.4% vs. 9.6%) and Grade 3 bleeding (1% vs. 1.4%). If bleeding necessitates medical intervention, consider permanent discontinuation of NEXAVAR. Hypertension may occur early in the course of treatment. Monitor blood pressure weekly during the first 6 weeks and periodically thereafter, and treat, if required. Hand-foot skin reaction and rash are common and management may include topical therapies for symptomatic relief. In cases of any severe or persistent adverse reactions, temporary treatment interruption, dose modification, or permanent discontinuation of NEXAVAR should be considered. NEXAVAR should be discontinued if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis are suspected as these may be life-threatening. Gastrointestinal perforation was an uncommon adverse reaction and has been reported in less than 1% of patients taking NEXAVAR. Discontinue NEXAVAR in the event of a gastrointestinal perforation. Patients taking concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in prothrombin time (PT), International Normalized Ratio (INR), or clinical bleeding episodes. Temporary interruption of NEXAVAR therapy is recommended in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. NEXAVAR, in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin, is not recommended in patients with squamous cell lung cancer. The safety and effectiveness of NEXAVAR has not been established in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. NEXAVAR can prolong the QT/QTc interval and increase the risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and monitor patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, and electrolyte abnormalities. Interrupt NEXAVAR if QTc interval is greater than 500 milliseconds or for an increase from baseline of 60 milliseconds or greater. Drug-induced hepatitis with NEXAVAR may result in hepatic failure and death. Liver function tests should be monitored regularly and in cases of increased transaminases without alternative explanation NEXAVAR should be discontinued. NEXAVAR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on NEXAVAR and female patients should also be advised against breastfeeding while receiving NEXAVAR. In DTC, NEXAVAR impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. Elevation of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level above 0.5 mU/L was observed in 41% of NEXAVAR-treated patients as compared with 16% of placebo-treated patients in the DTC study. Monitor TSH levels monthly and adjust thyroid replacement medication as needed in patients with DTC. Elevations in serum lipase and reductions in serum phosphate of unknown etiology have been associated with NEXAVAR. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers, when possible, because inducers can decrease the systemic exposure of sorafenib. NEXAVAR exposure decreases when co-administered with oral neomycin. Effects of other antibiotics on NEXAVAR pharmacokinetics have not been studied. Most common adverse reactions reported for NEXAVAR-treated patients vs. placebo-treated patients in unresectable HCC, respectively, were: diarrhea (55% vs. 25%), fatigue (46% vs. 45%), abdominal pain (31% vs. 26%), weight loss (30% vs. 10%), anorexia (29% vs. 18%), nausea (24% vs. 20%), and hand-foot skin reaction (21% vs. 3%). Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were 45% vs. 32%. Most common adverse reactions reported for NEXAVAR-treated patients vs. placebo-treated patients in advanced RCC, respectively, were: diarrhea (43% vs. 13%), rash/desquamation (40% vs. 16%), fatigue (37% vs. 28%), hand-foot skin reaction (30% vs. 7%), alopecia (27% vs. 3%), and nausea (23% vs. 19%). Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were 38% vs. 28%. Most common adverse reactions reported for NEXAVAR-treated patients vs. placebo-treated patients in DTC, respectively, were: Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) (69% vs. 8%), diarrhea (68% vs. 15%), alopecia (67% vs. 8%), weight loss (49% vs. 14%), fatigue (41% vs. 20%), hypertension (41% vs. 12%), rash (35% vs. 7%), decreased appetite (30% vs. 5%), stomatitis (24% vs. 3%), nausea (21% vs. 12%), pruritus (20% vs. 11%), and abdominal pain (20% vs. 7%). Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were 65% vs. 30%. For information about NEXAVAR including U.S. NEXAVAR prescribing information, visit www.NEXAVAR-us.com or call 1.866.NEXAVAR (1.866.639.2827).

No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those Amgen projects.  Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product.  Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans.  The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models.  The length of time that it takes for Amgen and its partners to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and Amgen expects similar variability in the future. Amgen develops product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures.   Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as Amgen may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, Amgen or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with Amgen's products after they are on the market. Amgen's business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims.  If Amgen fails to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between Amgen and the U.S. government, Amgen could become subject to significant sanctions. Amgen depends on third parties for a significant portion of its manufacturing capacity for the supply of certain of its current and future products and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of its current products and product candidate development. In addition, sales of Amgen's products (including products of Amgen's wholly-owned subsidiaries) are affected by the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment as well as U.S. legislation affecting pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement.  Government and others' regulations and reimbursement policies may affect the development, usage and pricing of Amgen's products.  In addition, Amgen competes with other companies with respect to some of its marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Amgen believes that some of its newer products, product candidates or new indications for existing products, may face competition when and as they are approved and marketed. Amgen's products may compete against products that have lower prices, established reimbursement, superior performance, are easier to administer, or that are otherwise competitive with its products.  In addition, while Amgen and its partners routinely obtain patents for their products and technology, the protection of Amgen's products offered by patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by its competitors and there can be no guarantee of Amgen's or its partners' ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for Amgen's products or product candidates. Amgen cannot guarantee that it will be able to produce commercially successful products or maintain the commercial success of its existing products. Amgen's stock price may be affected by actual or perceived market opportunity, competitive position, and success or failure of its products or product candidates.  Further, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of Amgen's products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on Amgen's business and results of operations. Amgen's efforts to integrate the operations of companies it has acquired may not be successful. The scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for Amgen's products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the products.  The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.

At the final pre-specified analysis, the favezelimab and pembrolizumab fixed-dose combination did not demonstrate an improvement in OS compared to standard of care (regorafenib or TAS-102 [trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride]). The safety profile of the fixed-dose combination was consistent with that observed for favezelimab and pembrolizumab in previously reported studies, with no new safety signals observed. A full evaluation of the data is ongoing and Merck will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community. “Metastatic colorectal cancer continues to be a challenging disease to treat, especially for the majority of patients who have microsatellite stable disease, which has had limited response to immunotherapies,” said Dr. M. Catherine Pietanza, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study, and we will continue to advance our clinical development program to evaluate KEYTRUDA-based combinations and novel candidates for patients with colorectal cancer in need of new options.” In the U.S., KEYTRUDA is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test. KEYTRUDA is not approved for the treatment of MSS mCRC. The favezelimab and pembrolizumab fixed-dose combination is also being evaluated in certain hematologic malignancies and multiple solid tumor types. Ongoing studies include KEYFORM-008 , a Phase 3 study evaluating the fixed-dose combination in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma whose disease has progressed following prior anti-PD-1 therapy. About KEYFORM-007 KEYFORM-007 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05064059 ) evaluating the fixed-dose combination of favezelimab and pembrolizumab (MK-4280A) versus standard of care, regorafenib or TAS-102 (trifluridine and tipiracil), for the treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive MSS mCRC who were previously treated with standard therapies. The primary endpoint is OS, and key secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, duration of response, safety and quality of life. The trial enrolled 441 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive: Favezelimab/pembrolizumab fixed-dose combination (favezelimab 800 mg and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously [IV]) on day 1, then every three weeks (Q3W) for 35 cycles, or Investigator’s choice of regorafenib orally once daily on days 1-12 of each 28-day cycle or TAS-102 orally twice daily on days 1-5 and days 8-12 of each 28-day cycle. About colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer can be referred to as colon cancer or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer starts. Colorectal cancer often begins with growths on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called polyps, which can change into cancer over time. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It is estimated there were nearly 1.9 million patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 900,000 patient deaths from the disease globally in 2022. In the United States, it is estimated that there will be approximately 107,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer and approximately 46,000 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer, resulting in more than 53,000 deaths from colorectal cancer in 2024. The five-year relative survival rates in the U.S. for metastatic colon cancer and rectal cancer (stage IV) are estimated to be 13% and 18%, respectively. About favezelimab Favezelimab (MK-4280) is an investigational anti-lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) antibody. LAG-3 is a cell surface immunomodulatory receptor expressed on various immune cells that down-regulates T cell proliferation and activation. Favezelimab aims to restore T cell effector function by preventing LAG-3 from binding to its primary ligand, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. The fixed-dose combination of favezelimab and pembrolizumab (MK-4280A) is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor types and in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma whose disease has progressed following prior anti-PD-1 therapy. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) as determined by an FDA-approved test. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti– PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant- related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose. Adverse Reactions In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

Despite opioids typically being reserved for limited or highly specific uses and not a treatment of choice for migraine, results from OVERCOME demonstrated that a high number of people are using opioids to treat their migraine. 1,3 These findings suggest that the real-world treatment of migraine is falling short of current scientific understanding of how to optimally treat this serious and disabling neurologic disease. ""The data from OVERCOME showed that, overall, opioids are being used in place of medicines that are approved and indicated to treat migraine, particularly among those who experience migraine headaches more frequently,"" said Sait Ashina , M.D., Department of Neurology and Department of Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Harvard Medical School , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. ""These data show that, despite the known potential risks of using opioids for migraine, far too many continue to do so. Against the backdrop of the U.S. opioid epidemic, it's concerning that many people may be using these drugs in place of therapies indicated for migraine."" The seminal 2009 American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study demonstrated that 16 percent of people with migraine were currently using opioids at the time of the study. 2 Data from OVERCOME collected in 2018 showed 19 percent of people with migraine were currently using opioids specifically to treat migraine. 1 This could represent a potential increase of tens of thousands of adults using opioids for migraine compared to the previous decade. 1,2 Furthermore, among OVERCOME participants who reported four or more migraine headaches per month, nearly 1 in 4 were currently using opioids (23.9%) and more than 50 percent of people in this group reported using opioids at some point to treat their migraine. 1 ""While diagnosis and treatment in migraine has significantly improved during the past decade or so, it's clear that for many, sub-optimal care is still a reality,"" said Eric Pearlman , M.D., Ph.D, senior medical director, U.S. neuroscience, Eli Lilly and Company. ""Considering the social, economic and health consequences of both migraine and opioid use, now is the time to close the treatment gap that has existed for too long. It's vital those living with this chronic, neurological disease are aware of and being counseled on appropriate treatment options for their migraine."" Lilly supports the efforts of organizations such as the American Headache Society, the American Migraine Foundation, the Migraine Research Foundation and the National Headache Foundation, among others, to promote scientific education that may lead to better outcomes for people affected by migraine. Raising awareness throughout the entire care continuum – from healthcare providers to patients and their caregivers – is vital to the holistic care and management of migraine. About the OVERCOME Study The O bser v ational Survey of the E pidemiology, T r eatment and C are o f M igrain e (OVERCOME) study aims to further understand the burden of migraine and stigma experienced by people living with the disease, identify barriers to appropriate treatment of migraine and assess how the introduction of novel treatment options may influence delivery of migraine care and outcomes. The OVERCOME study is a prospective, web-based patient survey designed to follow two U.S. population samples of 20,000 people with migraine for two years following their enrollment. The first population sample began enrollment in 2018, with the second population sample to begin enrollment in 2020. In parallel, the study also includes two U.S. population samples of 10,000 people without migraine during the same enrollment periods, providing a unique perspective about how migraine is perceived by those who do not have the disease.

In August 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The current indication remains unchanged and clinical trials continue, including KEYNOTE-048 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02358031), a phase 3 clinical trial of KEYTRUDA in the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. “We are encouraged by the positive impact that KEYTRUDA has had on many cancer patients, including those with previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer, and we remain confident that KEYTRUDA is an important therapy for this difficult-to-treat cancer,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We look forward to sharing the comprehensive data analysis from KEYNOTE-040 with the scientific community at an upcoming medical meeting.” The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 500 clinical trials, including more than 300 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. Specific to head and neck cancer, Merck’s broad clinical development program encompasses multiple registration-enabling or supportive studies investigating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments across multiple lines of therapy. About KEYNOTE-040 KEYNOTE-040 is a randomized, multi-center, pivotal phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02252042) investigating KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy versus standard treatment (methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The primary endpoint is OS; secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR). The study, which opened in November 2014, enrolled 495 patients to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks) or investigator-choice chemotherapy (methotrexate [40 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3-week cycle], docetaxel [75 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle], or cetuximab [400 mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1 and 250 mg/m 2 IV on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1], followed by cetuximab [250 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each subsequent 3-week cycle]). Patients enrolled in the study had been previously treated with 1-2 platinum-containing systemic regimens. About Head and Neck Cancer Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the flat, squamous cells that make up the thin surface layer of the structures in the head and neck. The leading modifiable risk factors for head and neck cancer include tobacco and heavy alcohol use. Other risk factors include infection with certain types of HPV, also called human papillomaviruses . Each year there are approximately 400,000 cases of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, in addition to approximately 160,000 cancers of the larynx, resulting in approximately 300,000 deaths. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Studies of KEYTRUDA – from the largest immuno-oncology program in the industry with more than 500 trials – include a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) clinical program seeks to understand factors that predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including the exploration of several different biomarkers across a broad range of tumors. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single-dose vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and progression-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. In metastatic NSCLC, KEYTRUDA is administered at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. When administering KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, KEYTRUDA should be administered prior to chemotherapy when given on the same day. See also the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and carboplatin. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients with HNSCC, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may occur in any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, rash (1.4%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (46%), decreased appetite (22%), and dyspnea (20%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose.

      important subgroups SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. --(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 4, 2018-- Vaxart, Inc. , a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing oral
      recombinant vaccines that are administered by tablet rather than by
      injection, today reported the topline results from a Phase 2 clinical
      trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an antiviral teslexivir 5%
      gel dosed topically twice daily in 218 subjects for the treatment of
      condyloma, or anogenital warts. The primary efficacy endpoint was
      defined as complete clearance of baseline condyloma by week 16. Analysis of the topline data demonstrated the study met all its primary
      safety objectives, with teslexivir showing a benign safety and
      tolerability profile, comparable to placebo. Adverse events and local
      skin reactions in the teslexivir group were also comparable with
      placebo, with mostly mild adverse events in both groups. No serious
      adverse events were observed. Early treatment termination, which we
      consider an important marker of product tolerability, was minimal with
      only 1.4% of patients discontinuing in either group. With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, 30.6% of patients in the
      teslexivir group completely cleared baseline condyloma by week 16,
      compared to 23.3% of patients in the placebo group. The difference was
      not statistically significant. In preliminary subgroup analysis, the
      rate of complete baseline condyloma clearance trended higher in female
      patients (37.5% teslexivir versus 23.3% placebo) and in patients with
      large condylomas (30.0% teslexivir versus 15.4% placebo), although
      results were not significant in either group. “While this trial did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint, we were
      pleased with the benign safety profile and positive efficacy trends in
      certain patient subpopulations,” said Wouter Latour , chief executive
      officer of Vaxart . “We are currently in the follow-up phase of the study
      and data collection should continue for a few more weeks. During this
      period, we will conduct further analysis of the results, which should
      inform us about the future steps with the teslexivir program. In the
      meantime, we will continue to focus on the advancement of our oral
      vaccine platform through the clinic.” A number of patients remain in the 3 month follow-up assessment period
      of the study. Following the completion of the last patient visit in the
      follow-up recurrence assessment period and the cleaning and lock of that
      portion of the study, Vaxart will report on the recurrence efficacy
      endpoints. About the Teslexivir Trial This teslexivir trial was a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of teslexivir 5% gel in male and female patients with
      condyloma, or anogenital warts. 218 female and male patients with 2-30
      external condyloma were randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with randomization
      stratified on gender, to be dosed twice daily for up to 16 weeks with
      teslexivir or placebo gel. Condyloma and local skin tolerability were
      measured and assessed by investigators at study visits occurring 2, 4,
      6, 9, 12 and 16 weeks following randomizations and initiation of dosing.
      If subjects cleared all condyloma prior to the end of 16 weeks, they
      proceeded directly to the 3-month untreated safety follow-up phase to
      assess for condyloma recurrence. The primary efficacy endpoint was to
      determine the complete clearance rate for baseline anogenital warts from
      the commencement of therapy to the end of the treatment period.
      Secondary efficacy endpoints include various assessments of clearance,
      time to clearance, and wart area reduction for both baseline warts and
      post-baseline emergent warts (i.e. all condyloma). Teslexivir is a topical antiviral agent that is a potent and selective
      inhibitor of the interaction between two essential viral proteins, E1
      and E2, an interaction that is a necessary step for human papilloma
      virus (HPV) DNA replication and thus viral production. About Condyloma (Anogenital Warts) Condyloma infections from HPV represent the most frequent viral sexually
      transmitted disease in adults worldwide, with >95% of condyloma caused
      by HPV 6 and 11. In the United States , approximately one to two percent
      of sexually active adults between the ages of 15 to 49 develop condyloma
      as the primary clinical manifestation of HPV infection. Currently
      available treatments for anogenital warts typically are divided into two
      categories, ablative/destructive therapies and topical therapies.
      Existing topical therapies are associated with significant mucosal
      toxicities manifesting as erosions and ulcerations, which can result in
      therapy discontinuation. Ablative options can be painful and scarring,
      and can lead to sexual dysfunction. Another significant limitation with
      current therapies is a high incidence of recurrence after successful
      primary treatment. About Vaxart Vaxart is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing
      oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine
      platform. Vaxart’s vaccines are designed to generate broad and durable
      immune responses that protect against a wide range of infectious
      diseases and may be useful for the treatment of chronic viral infections
      and cancer. Vaxart’s vaccines are administered using a convenient room
      temperature-stable tablet, rather than by injection. Vaxart believes
      that tablet vaccines are easier to distribute and administer than
      injectable vaccines and have the potential to significantly increase
      vaccination rates. Vaxart’s development programs include oral tablet
      vaccines that are designed to protect against norovirus, seasonal
      influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), as well as a
      therapeutic vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV). Vaxart is also
      developing several small-molecule antiviral drug candidates, including
      teslexivir (BTA074), an antiviral treatment for condyloma caused by HPV
      types 6 and 11. For more information, please visit www.vaxart.com . Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve

BENEFIT-ALS did not achieve its primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale in its revised form (ALSFRS-R) on tirasemtiv versus placebo (-2.98 points in the tirasemtiv group versus -2.40 points in the placebo group, p = 0.11).  Secondary efficacy analyses of the effect of tirasemtiv on respiratory function and other measures of skeletal muscle function produced mixed results. ""Patients with ALS desperately need new therapeutic alternatives to slow the course of their disease and loss of function. We stand with the ALS community in our disappointment that BENEFIT-ALS did not achieve its primary efficacy endpoint,"" stated Robert I. Blum, Cytokinetics' President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The results from BENEFIT-ALS are just now becoming available to our team at Cytokinetics and will be shared in more detail with the broader scientific and medical community focused to research in ALS in the next few days.  Understanding these results will require significant further review.  Once we have fully evaluated the data from BENEFIT-ALS, we expect to determine whether there is a potential development path forward for tirasemtiv for the potential treatment of ALS and what may be the appropriate next steps."" About Tirasemtiv Tirasemtiv , a novel skeletal muscle activator, is the lead drug candidate from Cytokinetics' skeletal muscle contractility program. Tirasemtiv selectively activates the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex by increasing its sensitivity to calcium and, in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, demonstrated increases in skeletal muscle force in response to neuronal input and delays in the onset and reductions in the degree of muscle fatigue. About BENEFIT-ALS BENEFIT-ALS was a Phase IIb, multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial which was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tirasemtiv in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). BENEFIT-ALS enrolled 711 patients in 73 centers in 8 countries.  Patients enrolled in BENEFIT-ALS began treatment with open-label tirasemtiv at 125 mg twice daily. Patients who tolerated this open-label treatment for one week were randomized to receive 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with twice-daily oral ascending doses of tirasemtiv or placebo, beginning at 125 mg twice daily and increasing weekly up to 250 mg twice daily (or a dummy dose titration with placebo). Clinical assessments occurred monthly during double-blind treatment; patients also returned for follow-up evaluations at one and four weeks after their final dose of double-blind study medication. The primary efficacy analysis of BENEFIT-ALS compared the mean change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale in its revised form (ALSFRS-R) on tirasemtiv versus placebo. Secondary endpoints evaluated measures of respiratory performance and other measures of skeletal muscle function and fatigability. About Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that afflicts approximately 25,000 people in the United States and a comparable number of patients in Europe. Approximately 5,600 new cases of ALS are diagnosed each year in the United States. The average life expectancy of an ALS patient is approximately three to five years after diagnosis and only 10% of patients survive for more than 10 years. Death is usually due to respiratory failure because of diminished strength in the skeletal muscles responsible for breathing. Few treatment options exist for these patients, resulting in a high unmet need for new therapeutic options to address the symptoms and modify the disease progression of this grievous illness. About Cytokinetics Cytokinetics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and medical conditions. Cytokinetics' lead drug candidate from its cardiac muscle contractility program, omecamtiv mecarbil , is in Phase II clinical development for the potential treatment of heart failure. Amgen Inc. holds an exclusive license worldwide to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds, subject to Cytokinetics' specified development and commercialization participation rights. Cytokinetics is independently developing tirasemtiv , a fast skeletal muscle activator, as a potential treatment for diseases and medical conditions associated with neuromuscular dysfunction. Tirasemtiv is currently the subject of a Phase II clinical trials program and has been granted orphan drug designation and fast track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and orphan medicinal product designation by the European Medicines Agency for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cytokinetics is collaborating with Astellas Pharma Inc. to develop CK-2127107, a skeletal muscle activator structurally distinct from tirasemtiv , for non-neuromuscular indications. All of these drug candidates have arisen from Cytokinetics' muscle biology focused research activities and are directed towards the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell. Additional information about Cytokinetics can be obtained at www.cytokinetics.com .

(NYSE:TEVA) (TASE:TEVA) and Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq:XENE) announce top-line results in a Phase II study of topical TV-45070 in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). TV-45070 did not meet the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change in pain from baseline to week four as assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS). Secondary endpoints were also not met. There were no safety concerns in the study. This was a Phase II proof of concept study seeking to understand the potential for a topical route of Nav1.7 blockade in PHN. Dr. Simon Pimstone , Xenon’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said: “While these results are disappointing for us from a scientific perspective and for patients needing new therapies to treat chronic neuropathic pain, Xenon remains focused on advancing its pipeline of neurology-related development candidates, with multiple programs anticipated to enter clinical development in 2017.” The companies plan to further analyze the data from this study to determine the next steps for TV-45070, and may look to present study data at a relevant forthcoming scientific conference. About TV-45070 TV-45070 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7, and other sodium channels, expressed in the pain-sensing peripheral nervous system. TV-45070 was licensed by Xenon to Teva in December 2012 . This Phase II trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TV-45070 in patients with PHN. The study included three treatment groups that received topical ointment containing 4% or 8% TV-45070 or placebo, dosed twice daily. The primary endpoint of this study was the change of average daily pain scores from baseline to week four, measured using an 11-point (0-10) numeric rating scale (NRS). Secondary endpoints included the percentage of patients with greater than 30% and greater than 50% improvement in pain scores, quality of life measurements and adverse events measurements. The study was carried out at 48 centers in the US and involved 300 patients randomized to 100 patients receiving 4% TV-45070, 100 patients receiving 8% TV-45070 and 100 patients receiving placebo.

Specifically, the study did not meet the primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) in the full study population or in the leiomyosarcoma (LMS) sub-population; there was no difference in survival between the study arms for either population. LARTRUVO was well tolerated; there were no new safety signals identified and the safety profile was comparable between treatment arms. Lilly plans to present the ANNOUNCE data at an upcoming medical conference and will publish the results in a medical journal. LARTRUVO in combination with doxorubicin previously showed an OS benefit in STS in a 133-patient, U.S.-only, randomized Phase 2 trial, which led to accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and conditional marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency. Continued approval is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. As ANNOUNCE did not confirm clinical benefit, Lilly is working with global regulators to determine the appropriate next steps for LARTRUVO. While these discussions are ongoing, patients who are currently receiving LARTRUVO may, in consultation with their physician, continue their course of therapy if they are receiving clinical benefit. For patients who have not previously received LARTRUVO, the results of the Phase 3 trial do not support initiating treatment with LARTRUVO in patients with STS, outside of participation in a clinical trial. At this time, Lilly is suspending promotion of LARTRUVO. ""Lilly was surprised and disappointed that LARTRUVO did not improve survival for patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma in this study,"" said Anne White , president, Lilly Oncology. ""Lilly is committed to helping people who have soft tissue sarcoma and we will carefully study the detailed data in an effort to better understand the different results between the two trials. We are thankful for the patients and physicians who have participated in the ANNOUNCE study."" LARTRUVO is also being studied in an ongoing global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in advanced STS in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel. Lilly expects to incur a charge in the first quarter of 2019 related to LARTRUVO. The exact amount of the charge has not yet been determined, but is estimated to be in the range of $70 million to $90 million (pre-tax), or approximately $0.10 per share (after tax). In addition, the company expects this to have an impact of approximately $0.17 per share on Lilly's full-year 2019 earnings per share guidance. Lilly will provide a full update to its 2019 financial guidance, including the impact of the potential Loxo Oncology acquisition, when it announces Q4 2018 earnings. This announcement does not change Lilly's 2020 minimum financial goals. About Soft Tissue Sarcoma Sarcomas are a diverse and relatively rare type of cancer that usually develop in the connective tissue of the body, which include fat, blood vessels, nerves, bones, muscles, deep skin tissues and cartilage. Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a complex disease with multiple subtypes, making it hard to diagnose and difficult to treat. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2018, an estimated 13,040 new STS cases will be diagnosed, and more than 5,000 people will not survive their disease in the U.S. alone. For decades, there have been no first-line therapeutic advancements for STS that have improved OS. About LARTRUVO ® (olaratumab) LARTRUVO is a platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) blocking antibody that specifically binds PDGFR-α and prevents receptor activation. LARTRUVO exhibits in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity against selected sarcoma cell lines and disrupted the PDGFR-α signaling pathway in in vivo tumor implant models. Information about additional clinical trials for LARTRUVO in sarcoma can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (in the search box on the home page, type in ""olaratumab""). About the ANNOUNCE Trial ANNOUNCE is a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study of LARTRUVO in combination with doxorubicin, followed by LARTRUVO monotherapy, versus doxorubicin plus placebo followed by placebo, in patients with advanced or metastatic STS. The two primary endpoints are OS in the ITT population and in the LMS sub-population. Patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic STS not amenable to curative treatment were enrolled and were eligible with any prior number of treatment regimens, provided they had not previously received treatment with an anthracycline. LARTRUVO was administered at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 and 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of all subsequent cycles in combination with doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 administered on day 1 of each cycle. Placebo was administered in combination with doxorubicin for 8 cycles. LARTRUVO was continued as monotherapy until disease progression. Key secondary endpoints include safety, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes. INDICATION LARTRUVO is indicated, in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with a histologic subtype for which an anthracycline-containing regimen is appropriate and which is not amenable to curative treatment with radiotherapy or surgery. This indication is approved under Accelerated Approval. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR LARTRUVO Warnings and Precautions Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions (IRR) occurred in 70 (14%) of 485 patients who received at least one dose of LARTRUVO across clinical trials. For 68 of these 70 patients (97%), the first occurrence of IRR was in the first or second cycle. Grade ≥3 IRR occurred in 11 (2.3%) of 485 patients, with one (0.2%) fatality. Symptoms of IRR included flushing, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, or fever/chills, and in severe cases symptoms manifested as severe hypotension, anaphylactic shock, or cardiac arrest. Infusion-related reactions required permanent discontinuation in 2.3% of patients and interruption of infusion in 10% of patients. All 59 patients with Grade 1 or 2 IRR resumed LARTRUVO; 12 (20%) of these patients had a Grade 1 or 2 IRR with rechallenge. The incidence of IRR in the overall safety database (N = 485) was similar (18% versus 12%) between those who did (56%) and those who did not (44%) receive premedication. Monitor patients during and following LARTRUVO infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Immediately and permanently discontinue LARTRUVO for Grade 3 or 4 IRR . Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, LARTRUVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal knockout models link disruption of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) signaling to adverse effects on embryo-fetal development. Administration of an anti-murine PDGFR-α antibody to pregnant mice during organogenesis caused malformations and skeletal variations. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LARTRUVO and for 3 months after the last dose. Most Common Adverse Reactions/Lab Abnormalities The most commonly reported adverse reactions (all grades; grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients receiving LARTRUVO plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone were nausea (73% vs 52%; 2% vs 3%), fatigue (69% vs 69%; 9% vs 3%), musculoskeletal pain (64% vs 25%; 8% vs 2%), mucositis (53% vs 35%; 3% vs 5%), alopecia (52% vs 40%; 0% vs 0%), vomiting (45% vs 19%; 0% vs 0%), diarrhea (34% vs 23%; 3% vs 0%) decreased appetite (31% vs 20%; 2% vs 0%), abdominal pain (23% vs 14%; 3% vs 0%), neuropathy (22% vs 11%; 0% vs 0%), and headache (20% vs 9%; 0% vs 0%). The most common laboratory abnormalities (all grades; grade 3-4) occurring in ≥20% of patients receiving LARTRUVO plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone were lymphopenia (77% vs 73%; 44% vs 37%), neutropenia (65% vs 63%; 48% vs 38%) and thrombocytopenia (63% vs 44%; 6% vs 11%), hyperglycemia (52% vs 28%; 2% vs 3%), elevated aPTT (33% vs 13%; 5% vs 0%), hypokalemia (21% vs 15%; 8% vs 3%), and hypophosphatemia (21% vs 7%; 5% vs 3%). Use in Specific Populations Lactation: Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfeeding infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LARTRUVO and for at least 3 months following the last dose.

Dec 14, 2020 The global pandemic has left virtually no part of the world untouched, and moved our industry to collaborate like never before, and leverage our expertise and resources to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The RUXCOVID clinical trial is a testament to the Novartis commitment to contribute to these efforts. Click here for the RUXCOVID first interpretable results media release While the RUXCOVID trial did not give us the results we hoped for, we will continue working with the medical community to analyze its findings, potentially improving understanding about COVID-19 and the role of JAK inhibition. We are proud to be part of the international effort to address the global pandemic; and we would like to thank the front-line clinical teams and staff at each of the trial sites, as well as the patients who volunteered to participate on the trial and their loved ones. Stages of COVID-19 and the RUXCOVID trial The time course of COVID-19 progression, showing increasing disease severity through the three stages of the disease: early infection, pulmonary and hyperinflammation phase. The RUXCOVID trial focused on hospitalized patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with COVID-19 infection, who were at risk for severe complications including ICU care, mechanical ventilation or death. This includes people whose lungs are affected and have low blood oxygen levels (Stage IIB). Frequently asked questions What is RUXCOVID? RUXCOVID is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 29-day, multi-center Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib plus standard of care (SoC) therapy in patients aged ≥12 years with COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. More information is available at ClinicalTrials.gov . Why was RUXCOVID initiated? Ruxolitinib is a well-established JAK inhibitor and has been shown to reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with myelofibrosis, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), and graft versus host disease (GvHD). Patients with severe COVID-19 have substantially elevated cytokine levels leading to a state of hyperinflammation (cytokine release syndrome or CRS). Morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19 is associated with this CRS. Ruxolitinib treatment results in the decrease of inflammation-related markers, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated T cells. Pre-clinical evidence as well as preliminary reports from independent studies suggest that ruxolitinib may reduce the number of patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Overall, these lines of evidence suggested that ruxolitinib could improve hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19 and have potential as a therapeutic option in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Based on this, the randomized phase III trial, RUXCOVID, was initiated in order to further evaluate this in a prospective, randomized manner. What was the outcome of the RUXCOVID study? The Phase III study did not meet its primary endpoint. Initial data show there was no statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients on ruxolitinib plus SoC therapy who experienced severe complications, including death, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) by Day 29, compared to SoC alone. The trial also did not show clinically relevant benefit among secondary and exploratory endpoints including mortality rate by Day 29, and time to recovery (no longer infected, or ambulatory with no or minimal limitations). Were there any safety concerns? Ruxolitinib was generally well-tolerated; a comprehensive analysis including safety data is ongoing. Does Novartis have other clinical trials in COVID-19? Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI). Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19 related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-19. What else is Novartis doing to help combat COVID-19? For the most up to date information on our ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic please take a look at novartis.com/coronavirus.

The 315-patient, open-label study evaluated single-agent Kyprolis ® (carfilzomib) for Injection compared to an active control regimen of low-dose dexamethasone, or equivalent corticosteroids, plus optional cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed and advanced refractory multiple myeloma. Nearly all patients in the control arm received cyclophosphamide. Patients were heavily pretreated and had received a median of five therapeutic regimens prior to study entry. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events and on-study deaths were comparable between the two arms. The rate of cardiac events observed in the Kyprolis arm was consistent with the current U.S. Kyprolis label. There was an increase in the incidence  of renal adverse events of all grades observed in the Kyprolis arm compared to the active control arm and the label. ""While it is unfortunate that the FOCUS study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival, we believe the results from the recent positive ASPIRE Phase 3 clinical trial will be sufficient to support regulatory submissions around the world,"" said Pablo J. Cagnoni , M.D., president, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Detailed results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. About FOCUS The randomized, open-label Phase 3 FOCUS (Car F ilz O mib for Advan C ed Refractory M U ltiple Myeloma European S tudy) trial evaluated single-agent Kyprolis versus an active control regimen of low-dose steroids plus optional cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed and advanced refractory multiple myeloma following treatment with at least three prior therapies. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, duration of response and safety. Patients were randomized to receive Kyprolis (20mg/m 2 on days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 followed by 27mg/m 2 on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of cycle 1 and all doses cycle 2 through 9, and 27 mg/m 2 on days 1,2,15, and 16 of cycle 10 and beyond) or an active control regimen of oral steroids and optional cyclophosphamide. The trial enrolled 315 patients. About Multiple Myeloma Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer and results from an abnormality of plasma cells, usually in the bone marrow. In the U.S., approximately 70,000 people are living with multiple myeloma and approximately 24,000 new cases are diagnosed annually.[1] Worldwide, nearly 230,000 people are living with multiple myeloma and approximately 114,000 new cases are diagnosed annually.[2] In Europe, approximately 89,000 people are living with multiple myeloma, and approximately 39,000 new cases are diagnosed annually.[3] About Kyprolis ® (carfilzomib) for Injection On July 20, 2012 , the FDA granted accelerated approval of Kyprolis ® (carfilzomib) for Injection for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. Approval was based on response rate. Clinical benefit, such as improvement in survival or symptoms, has not been verified. Kyprolis is marketed in the U.S. by Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , an Amgen subsidiary. Important Safety Information Regarding Kyprolis ® (carfilzomib) for Injection Safety data have been evaluated in 526 patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who received single-agent Kyprolis. There were 37 deaths in the Phase 2 studies, or 7% of patients. The most common causes of death, other than disease progression, were cardiac (5 patients), end-organ failure (4 patients), and infection (4 patients). Important warnings and precautions include cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia; pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary complications, infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, thrombocytopenia, hepatic toxicity and embryo-fetal toxicity. Death due to cardiac arrest has occurred within a day of Kyprolis administration. Patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, myocardial infarction in the preceding 6 months, and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by medications were not eligible for the clinical trials. These patients may be at greater risk for cardiac complications. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was reported in 2% of patients treated with Kyprolis and was Grade 3 or greater in less than 1% of patients. Dyspnea was reported in 35% of patients enrolled in clinical trials. Grade 3 dyspnea occurred in 5%; no Grade 4 events, and 1 death (Grade 5) was reported. Infusion reactions, characterized by a spectrum of systemic symptoms including fever, chills, arthralgia, myalgia, facial flushing, facial edema, vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath, hypotension, syncope, chest tightness, or angina can occur immediately following or up to 24 hours after administration of Kyprolis. Administration of dexamethasone prior to Kyprolis reduces the incidence and severity of reactions. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred following Kyprolis administration in < 1% of patients. Patients with multiple myeloma and a high tumor burden should be considered to be at greater risk for TLS. Thrombocytopenia following Kyprolis administration resulted in a dose reduction in 1% of patients and discontinuation of treatment with Kyprolis in < 1% of patients. Cases of hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported (< 1%). Kyprolis can cause elevations of serum transaminases and bilirubin. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women using Kyprolis. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Kyprolis. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, acute renal failure, pyrexia, and congestive heart failure. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of 30% or greater) observed in clinical trials of patients with multiple myeloma were fatigue, anemia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, diarrhea, and pyrexia. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 45% of patients. Full prescribing information is available at www.kyprolis.com .

At the final analysis, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA did not improve OS or PFS sufficiently to meet the study’s prespecified statistical criteria in the first-line treatment of certain patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma versus a standard of care, platinum-based chemotherapy doublet (carboplatin plus paclitaxel). The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies evaluating the combination. A full evaluation of the data from this study is ongoing. The companies will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community. “We remain confident in the proven benefit of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA for the treatment of appropriate patients with certain types of previously treated advanced endometrial carcinoma based on results from the KEYNOTE-775/Study 309 trial and will continue to research the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination in patients with other types of difficult-to-treat cancers,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are disappointed that the LEAP-001 trial did not reach its primary endpoints, as we had hoped to bring another potential treatment option to patients when first diagnosed with certain types of advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma.” “Results from the LEAP-001 trial underscore the challenges of treating patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma in the first-line setting,” said Dr. Corina Dutcus, Senior Vice President, Oncology Global Clinical Development Lead at Eisai Inc. “We remain optimistic about the clinical development program for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA and are proud that the combination has become a standard of care option for patients with certain types of advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma whose disease has progressed following prior systemic therapy and will continue our efforts to contribute to these patients. We are grateful to the patients, their loved ones, and the investigators whose participation is what makes scientific advancement possible.” KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma following prior systemic therapy in any setting and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYX for advanced RCC in the EU. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in various tumor types, including but not limited to hepatocellular carcinoma, RCC, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer across multiple clinical trials. Results from the LEAP-001 trial do not affect the current approved indications for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination or other ongoing trials from the LEAP clinical program. About LEAP-001 LEAP-001 is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03884101 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus carboplatin plus paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The dual primary endpoints are PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. The secondary endpoints include objective response rate, as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, quality of life measures and safety. The study enrolled an estimated 842 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive: KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily); or Paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle) plus carboplatin (IV infusion at a total dose of area-under-the-curve 6 [per Calvert’s formula] given on Day 1 of each three-week cycle). About endometrial carcinoma Endometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus, which is known as the endometrium, and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. Worldwide, it was estimated there were more than 417,000 new cases of uterine body cancer diagnosed and more than 97,000 deaths from the disease in 2020 (these estimates include both endometrial carcinomas and uterine sarcomas; more than 90% of uterine body cancers occur in the endometrium, so the actual numbers for endometrial carcinoma cases and deaths may be slightly lower than these estimates). In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 19,200 new cases of advanced uterine body cancer diagnosed in 2023. The five-year relative survival rate for metastatic endometrial carcinoma (stage IV) is estimated to be approximately 20%. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Endometrial Carcinoma KEYTRUDA, in combination with LENVIMA, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is pMMR as determined by an FDA-approved test or not MSI-H, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Please see Prescribing Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_pi.pdf and Medication Guide for KEYTRUDA at http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/k/keytruda/keytruda_mg.pdf . About LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is an orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S. For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA Warnings and Precautions Hypertension. In DTC (differentiated thyroid cancer), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC (renal cell carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC. Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity. Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Among patients receiving LENVIMA with pembrolizumab, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%). Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients.

If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%.

In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity. Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms. Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC. Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA. Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution. Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.

The pooled analyses of the LUSTER trials did not meet 3 the clinically relevant threshold for reduction in rate of moderate -to-severe exacerbation compared to placebo over a 52-week treatment period for either of the doses (150mg / 450 mg). The studies included patients who had inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe asthma (GINA Steps 4 and 5) despite receiving inhaled mid-to-high dose corticosteroids (ICS) and at least one additional controller. The totality of these results do not support further development of fevipiprant in asthma. Fevipiprant was generally well tolerated, with treatment-emergent adverse events generally balanced across groups and comparable to placebo 3 . Detailed efficacy and safety data from the LUSTER-1 and LUSTER-2 studies are being analyzed and will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical congress. “While the results of the LUSTER studies with fevipiprant are disappointing, they meaningfully contribute to our understanding of the DP 2 pathway in asthma. We are incredibly grateful to all the patients, their families and the investigators who participated in the studies and contributed greatly to this research,” said John Tsai, Head Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. The pivotal replicate LUSTER-1 1 and LUSTER-2 2 studies are part of the VIBRANT Phase III program, which also includes the SPIRIT 4 safety study and the supplemental replicate ZEAL-1 5 and ZEAL-2 6 studies. Topline results from ZEAL-1 and ZEAL-2 were announced in October 2019. Novartis continues to invest into respiratory medicines with in-market products Xolair ®7 (severe allergic asthma [SAA] and chronic spontaneous urticaria [CSU]), Ultibro ® Breezhaler ® 8 (COPD), Phase III investigational products QVM149 9 (moderate-to-severe asthma), and QMF149 10 (moderate-to-severe asthma), as well as active research programs covering asthma, COPD and other areas of high unmet need, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis. About Fevipiprant Fevipiprant is an investigational, novel, steroid-free once-daily pill. It blocks the DP 2 pathway 11 , a potentially important regulator of the asthma inflammatory cascade 12 . About LUSTER-1 and LUSTER-2 1,2 LUSTER-1 and LUSTER-2 (CQAW039A2307, NCT02555683 and CQAW039A2314, NCT02563067) were 52-week, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, replicate Phase III studies in patients with moderate-severe asthma. The patient population included 894 (LUSTER-1) and 877 (LUSTER-2) patients aged ≥12 years, all of whom suffer from inadequately controlled moderate-severe asthma, receiving Global Initiative for Asthma 13 (GINA) Steps 4 and 5 standard-of-care (SoC) asthma therapy: inhaled mid-to-high dose corticosteroids (ICS) and at least one additional controller. Recruitment was stratified based on blood eosinophil counts at Visit 1, so that approximately two-thirds of randomized patients had a blood eosinophil count ≥250 cells/μl and one-third had a blood eosinophil count <250 cells/μL, to determine the effect of fevipiprant across patients with varying eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either fevipiprant 150 mg, fevipiprant 450 mg or placebo once daily. The aim of these studies was to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of fevipiprant in addition to the current standard-of-care for severe asthma patients. The primary endpoint for the replicate LUSTER-1 and LUSTER-2 studies was the reduction of the annual rate of moderate‐to‐severe exacerbations over a 52‐week treatment period in patients with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma and high levels (≥ 250 cells/µL) of a type of white blood cell called eosinophils. The rate of reduction in all patients independent of blood eosinophil level was also studied as part of the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included change in asthma quality of life (as measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ] for people 12 years and older), asthma control (measured via Asthma Control Questionnaire‐5), and lung function (measured via FEV1) over the 52‐week treatment period in patients with high blood eosinophil counts (≥250 cells/μl)  and in all patients independent of blood eosinophil level. Safety of fevipiprant in terms of adverse events, electrocardiograms, vital signs and laboratory tests was also assessed. About Moderate-to-Severe Asthma The severity of asthma ranges between mild, moderate and severe, with more severe asthma requiring more treatment (higher dose or stronger medication) to control symptoms and exacerbations. According to the the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) stepwise approach to asthma treatment, patients between Step 3 and Step 5 are considered moderate-to-severe 13 . Despite the availability of standard-of-care asthma treatments for the moderate-to-severe asthma patients, over 45% at GINA Step 4 and 5 remain uncontrolled 14 . These uncontrolled asthma patients often downplay or underestimate the severity of their asthma by tolerating their symptoms and accepting the severe impact of their disease on their quality of life 15 . These patients are at an increased risk of experiencing a severe exacerbation, hospitalization, or death 15,16,17 .

In the study, opicinumab missed the primary endpoint, a multicomponent measure evaluating improvement of physical function, cognitive function, and disability. However, evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose-response was observed. “It is only through taking thoughtful, calculated risks that we can bring major advances to patients,” said Alfred Sandrock, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen. “Achieving repair of the human central nervous system through remyelination would be a substantial achievement, and while we missed the primary endpoint, the SYNERGY study results suggest evidence of a clinical effect of opicinumab. Due to the complex nature of the data set, we continue to analyze the results to inform the design of our next study.” Opicinumab also did not meet the secondary efficacy endpoint in SYNERGY, which evaluated the slowing of disability progression. Safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed as secondary endpoints. Opicinumab was generally well-tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in prior studies. Opicinumab showed a linear, well-behaved PK profile over the studied dose range. SYNERGY results will be presented at future medical meetings. About the Opicinumab (anti-LINGO-1) Phase 2 Development Program The two Phase 2 trials (RENEW and SYNERGY) were designed to assess the biological activity and clinical potential of opicinumab (anti-LINGO-1) in central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases. RENEW was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the effect of opicinumab treatment following a first episode of acute optic neuritis. Opicinumab 100 mg/kg was administered intravenously once every four weeks for 20 weeks (total of six doses). Results from RENEW showed improved latency recovery, as measured by the primary endpoint full-field visual evoked potential (FF-VEP), among opicinumab participants, compared with placebo. The study showed no effect on the secondary endpoints of change in thickness of the retinal layers (optic nerve neurons and axons) or visual function, as measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and low contrast letter acuity, respectively. SYNERGY was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2 study that evaluated the impact of opicinumab among 418 participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (both relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive) over 72 weeks. The primary endpoint of the SYNERGY study was a multicomponent measure evaluating the number of study participants who experienced three month confirmed improvement of ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk; T25FW), upper extremity function (9-Hole Peg Test; 9HPT), cognition (3-Second Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; PASAT) and standard measures of physical disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS). Secondary endpoints measured slowing of progression on the same components, as well as the safety and pharmacokinetics of opicinumab. Statistical testing assessed the dose-response trend based on the primary or secondary endpoint. Opicinumab was administered intravenously every four weeks at doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg. All study participants received concurrent treatment with 30 mcg interferon beta-1a intramuscular injection once weekly.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Eisai today announced that the Phase 3 LEAP-002 trial investigating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, plus LENVIMA, the orally available multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai, versus LENVIMA monotherapy did not meet its dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). There were trends toward improvement in OS and PFS for patients who received KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus LENVIMA monotherapy; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. The median OS of the LENVIMA monotherapy arm in LEAP-002 was longer than that observed in previously reported clinical trials evaluating LENVIMA monotherapy in uHCC. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was consistent with previously reported data on the combination. Merck and Eisai plan to present these data at an upcoming medical conference. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220803005211/en/ “Our joint clinical development program for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is designed to address unmet needs for some of the most challenging-to-treat types of cancer, like hepatocellular carcinoma,” said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Developement, Merck Research Laboratories. “We remain confident in the potential of this combination based on the body of evidence we’ve seen to date and will continue to investigate its role across multiple types of cancer.” “Aiming for further improvement in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC, we selected LENVIMA monotherapy, a standard of care option, as the control arm of the LEAP-002 trial,” said Corina Dutcus, M.D., Senior Vice President, Clinical Research, Oncology at Eisai Inc. “While results evaluating the combination are not what we had hoped for, we will continue to contribute to the care of patients with unresectable HCC by applying valuable knowledge from the LEAP-002 trial.” LENVIMA monotherapy is approved for the first-line treatment of patients with uHCC in the U.S., Europe, and China, and for patients with uHCC in Japan. The approval of LENVIMA was based on results of the Phase 3 REFLECT trial which evaluated the efficacy and safety of LENVIMA versus sorafenib for the first-line treatment of patients with uHCC. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation and for adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the first-line setting. In Europe, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA (marketed as KISPLYX ® for RCC in the EU) is approved for adult patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma who have disease progression on or following prior treatment with a platinum containing therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation and for adults with advanced RCC in the first-line setting. The KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination is also approved in Japan for patients with radically unresectable or metastatic RCC and patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma that progressed after cancer chemotherapy. Results from the LEAP-002 trial do not affect the current approved indications for the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in more than 10 different tumor types (endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, biliary tract cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer) across more than 15 clinical trials. About LEAP-002 LEAP-002 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled Phase 3 trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03713593 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus LENVIMA monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with uHCC. The dual primary endpoints are PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST) v1.1 (RECIST v1.1 has been modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ), and OS. The secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, and duration of response (DOR). The study enrolled 794 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive: KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle) plus LENVIMA (12 mg orally once daily [for patients with screening body weight of at least 60 kg] or 8 mg orally once daily [for patients with screening body weight less than 60 kg]); or LENVIMA (12 mg orally once daily [for patients with screening body weight of at least 60 kg] or 8 mg orally once daily [for patients with screening body weight less than 60 kg]) plus saline placebo (IV administered on Day 1 of each three-week cycle). LENVIMA was administered until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. KEYTRUDA/placebo was administered for up to 35 cycles (approximately two years). About hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of primary liver cancer and the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers. It is estimated there were more than 905,000 new cases of liver cancer and more than 830,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2020, making it the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths around the world. In the United States, it is estimated there will be over 41,000 new cases of liver cancer and over 30,000 deaths from this disease in 2022. Risk factors for liver cancer include gender, ethnicity, chronic viral hepatitis (Hep-B or Hep-C) infection, cirrhosis, alcohol use and metabolic syndrome. Hepatocellular carcinoma, which is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, has a five-year survival rate of approximately 20% in the U.S. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Hepatocellular Carcinoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

About LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib); available as 10 mg and 4 mg capsules LENVIMA, discovered and developed by Eisai, is a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with a concurrent inhibition of FGF-receptor substrate 2α (FRS2α) phosphorylation. The combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, the combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity compared to either treatment alone. LENVIMA ® (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S. For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) In combination with KEYTRUDA, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy For the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) In combination with KEYTRUDA, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. Selected Safety Information for LENVIMA Warnings and Precautions Hypertension. In DTC (differentiated thyroid cancer), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC (renal cell carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC. Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity. Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials. Among patients receiving LENVIMA with pembrolizumab, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%). Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients.

Grade 3-5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% of patients with DTC and 2% of patients with HCC, including 1 fatal event in each study. In RCC, renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (10% grade 3). Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue for renal failure or impairment based on severity. Proteinuria. In DTC and HCC, proteinuria was reported in 34% and 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in DTC and HCC, respectively. In RCC, proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus (8% grade 3). Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula. QT Interval Prolongation. In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%. In RCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC, QTc interval increases of >60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval >500 ms occurred in 2%. Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity. Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms. Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials. Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity. Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC. Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice. Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA. Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution. Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose.

The results were presented through the European Society of Cardiology's HFA Discoveries program. ""The EMPERIAL trials, which assessed exercise ability, are one piece of our clinical program evaluating the potential of Jardiance in treating heart failure, a condition affecting 60 million people worldwide,"" said Mohamed Eid , M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A., vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Cardio-Metabolism & Respiratory Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ""At the center of our heart failure program are the ongoing EMPEROR trials, which are investigating outcomes including cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure and quality of life. We look forward to sharing results from the EMPEROR-Reduced trial this year for people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction."" As previously reported, the EMPERIAL trials showed no significant difference in change from baseline to week 12 in exercise ability with Jardiance versus placebo, as measured by the six-minute walk test, which was the primary endpoint of the studies. In EMPERIAL-Reduced, the median six-minute walk test increased by 13.5 meters with Jardiance compared with 18.0 meters with placebo. In EMPERIAL-Preserved the increase was 10.0 meters with Jardiance versus 5.0 meters with placebo. Exploratory analyses of EMPERIAL-Reduced suggest Jardiance was associated with improvements in quality of life. Researchers employed the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a widely used patient-reported measure of quality of life for heart failure. Mean improvement in total symptom score (TSS) of the KCCQ from baseline to week 12 was 4.55 points higher for Jardiance compared with placebo. Additionally, a greater proportion of those taking Jardiance had improvements compared with placebo in KCCQ-TSS of at least 5 and at least 8 points – two pre-specified thresholds that were identified to measure clinically meaningful response to treatment. Similar exploratory analyses of EMPERIAL-Preserved did not indicate improvements with Jardiance versus placebo in these same measures for adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The EMPERIAL trials included people with and without diabetes. The safety profile in those with diabetes was similar to the known safety profile of Jardiance for adults with type 2 diabetes. In those without diabetes, no new safety events were identified, and the frequency of hypoglycemic events with Jardiance in this population was similar to that of placebo. Overall, in both trials, there was no notable difference between Jardiance and placebo in the frequency of adverse events, including those leading to discontinuation of study medication, and no new safety concerns were identified. Other heart failure guideline-recommended therapies have shown divergent results between studies examining clinical outcomes and symptom improvement, with some showing improvements in outcomes such as mortality, but neutral or inconsistent results in exercise ability and patient-reported outcomes. ""Cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, a group of disorders affecting the heart, kidneys and endocrine systems, are becoming increasingly common,"" said Jeff Emmick , M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. ""Our EMPOWER clinical trial program, which is exploring the impact of Jardiance across the spectrum of cardio-renal-metabolic conditions, is one of the broadest and most comprehensive of any SGLT2 inhibitor. Through our research we aim to contribute new knowledge that can help improve outcomes for the millions of people affected by these conditions."" About EMPERIAL EMPERIAL consisted of two Phase III randomized, double-blind trials in adults with or without diabetes. The trials evaluated the effect of 12 weeks' treatment of once-daily Jardiance 10 mg compared with placebo on exercise ability and heart failure symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction.* The primary endpoint was measured by the six-minute walk test, a common measure of exercise ability. EMPERIAL-Preserved [ NCT03448406 ]: investigated Jardiance in patients with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The study looked at a functional endpoint — how far patients can walk in six minutes — and at heart failure symptoms. Primary endpoint: Change from baseline to week 12 in exercise ability as measured by the distance walked in six minutes Number of patients enrolled: 315 Completed: October 9, 2019 EMPERIAL-Reduced [ NCT03448419 ]: investigated Jardiance in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The study looked at a functional endpoint — how far patients can walk in six minutes — and at heart failure symptoms. Primary endpoint: Change from baseline to week 12 in exercise ability as measured by the distance walked in six minutes Number of patients enrolled: 312 Completed: October 7, 2019 *Ejection fraction is a measurement expressed as a percentage of the amount of blood that leaves the heart each time it contracts, related to the total blood volume of the heart chambers. During each heartbeat pumping cycle, the heart contracts and relaxes. When the heart contracts, it ejects blood from the two pumping chambers (ventricles). When the heart relaxes, the ventricles refill with blood. HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricle muscles are stiff. They do not relax as they should when the ventricle fills with blood, so less blood can enter the heart compared to a normally functioning heart. HFrEF occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively and less blood is pumped out to the body compared to a normally functioning heart. Both HFpEF and HFrEF lead to similar symptoms of heart failure, specifically difficulty breathing, swelling and fatigue. About EMPOWER The EMPOWER program reinforces the long-term commitment of Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company to evaluate the potential of Jardiance to improve outcomes for adults living with cardio-renal-metabolic conditions. EMPOWER is one of the largest clinical trial programs for an SGLT2 inhibitor to date with more than 13,000 adults worldwide. The development program encompasses: EMPEROR-Reduced, in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization due to heart failure EMPEROR-Preserved, in adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization due to heart failure EMPULSE, in adults hospitalized for acute heart failure to improve clinical and patient reported outcomes EMPACT-MI, to improve outcomes and prevent heart failure in adults with and without diabetes who have had an acute myocardial infarction EMPA-KIDNEY, in adults with established chronic kidney disease to reduce the progression of kidney disease and the occurrence of cardiovascular death EMPERIAL-Reduced, in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to improve exercise ability and patient reported outcomes EMPERIAL-Preserved, in adults with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction to improve exercise ability and patient reported outcomes EMPA-REG OUTCOME ® , in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death EMPRISE, assessing comparative efficacy, safety, healthcare resource utilization and costs of care in routine clinical care in adult patients with diabetes About Heart Failure Heart failure is a progressive, debilitating and potentially fatal condition that occurs when the heart cannot supply adequate circulation to meet the body's demands for oxygenated blood or to do so requires increased blood volume leading to fluid accumulation (congestion) in the lungs and peripheral tissues. It is a widespread condition affecting 60 million people worldwide and expected to increase as the population ages. Heart failure is highly prevalent in people with diabetes; however, approximately half of all people with heart failure do not have diabetes. The Jardiance heart failure program was initiated based on data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which assessed the effect of Jardiance added to standard of care compared with placebo added to standard of care. EMPA-REG OUTCOME was the first SGLT2 inhibitor trial to show a relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. This population was comprised of more than 45% of adults with a prior myocardial infarction. About Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Conditions Cardio-renal-metabolic conditions are a group of interconnected disorders affecting the heart, kidneys and endocrine system. In aggregate, these conditions are the leading cause of deaths worldwide, accounting for up to 20 million deaths annually. Conditions within this group include coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, among many others. Emerging science on the link between the cardiorenal and metabolic systems supports taking a multidisciplinary approach toward diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for people living with these conditions. We remain committed to developing treatments with broad cardio-renal-metabolic effects, which may help improve outcomes for people with serious chronic conditions such as these. Wh a t is JARDIANCE?

However, an analysis of the secondary study endpoints of both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) showed evidence of monotherapy activity in the abemaciclib arm. In addition, the control arm showed a higher overall survival rate than expected based on historical data in this setting. Lilly will submit the data for presentation at a medical meeting in 2018. ""While the outcome is unfortunate for patients with KRAS-mutated, advanced lung cancer, we remain encouraged by the antitumor activity observed with abemaciclib in this form of lung cancer where few clinical advances have been achieved,"" said Levi Garraway , M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president, global development and medical affairs, Lilly Oncology. Dr. Garraway added, ""As we analyze secondary endpoints and explore specific patient subgroups in order to better evaluate the prospects for abemaciclib in NSCLC, we will continue to work with the oncology community to inform potential future treatment avenues for patients with KRAS-mutated advanced lung cancer. Moreover, we have several studies ongoing of rational combinations that include abemaciclib in non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies. We look forward to seeing the results of these studies."" JUNIPER, a global Phase 3, interventional, open-label study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib versus erlotinib in patients with stage IV NSCLC with a detectable KRAS mutation, who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and who may have received one additional systemic therapy. A total of 453 patients were randomized to receive 200 mg of abemaciclib orally twice a day on a continuous dosing schedule, every 12 hours or 150 mg of erlotinib administered at its approved dose and schedule until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the study was OS, with key secondary endpoints of safety, ORR, and PFS. The adverse events were generally consistent with previous studies of abemaciclib, with the most common adverse events being diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, and nausea. Notes to Editor About Verzenio ™ (abemaciclib) Verzenio (abemaciclib) is an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6, which are activated by binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4 & 6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. Verzenio disrupts the cell cycle. Preclinically, Verzenio dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size. In vitro, continuous exposure to Verzenio inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis (cell death). Inhibiting CDK4 & 6 in healthy cells can result in side effects, some of which may be serious. Clinical evidence also suggests that Verzenio crosses the blood-brain barrier. 1 INDICATION Verzenio is indicated: in combination with fulvestrant for women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Diarrhea occurred in 86% of patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2 and 90% of patients receiving Verzenio alone in MONARCH 1. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2 and in 20% of patients receiving Verzenio alone in MONARCH 1. Episodes of diarrhea have been associated with dehydration and infection. In MONARCH 2, diarrhea incidence was greatest during the first month of Verzenio dosing. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 6 days, and the median duration of diarrhea for Grades 2 and 3 were 9 days and 6 days, respectively. Twenty-two percent of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 22% required a dose reduction. In the MONARCH 1 study, the time to onset and resolution for diarrhea were similar to those in MONARCH 2. Instruct patients that at the first sign of loose stools, they should start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow-up. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue Verzenio until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade 1, and then resume Verzenio at the next lower dose. Neutropenia occurred in 46% of patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2 and 37% of patients receiving Verzenio alone in MONARCH 1. A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 32% of patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2 and in 27% of patients receiving Verzenio in MONARCH 1. In MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1, the median time to first episode of Grade >3 neutropenia was 29 days, and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 15 days. Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1% of patients exposed to Verzenio in MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 1. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider. Grade ≥3 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (4% versus 2%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2% versus 3%) were reported in the Verzenio and placebo arms respectively, in MONARCH 2. In MONARCH 2, for patients receiving Verzenio plus fulvestrant with Grade ≥3 ALT increased, median time to onset was 57 days, and median time to resolution to Grade <3 was 14 days. For patients with Grade ≥3 AST increased, median time to onset was 185 days, and median time to resolution was 13 days. For assessment of potential hepatotoxicity , monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of Verzenio therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4, hepatic transaminase elevation. Venous thromboembolic events were reported in 5% of patients treated with Verzenio plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2 as compared to 0.9% of patients treated with fulvestrant plus placebo. Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. Across the clinical development program, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Verzenio can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Verzenio and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose. There are no data on the presence of Verzenio in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Advise lactating women not to breastfeed during Verzenio treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants. Based on findings in animals, Verzenio may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. The most common adverse reactions (all grades, ≥10%) observed in MONARCH 2 for Verzenio plus fulvestrant and ≥2% higher than placebo plus fulvestrant were diarrhea (86% vs 25%), neutropenia (46% vs 4%), fatigue (46% vs 32%), nausea (45% vs 23%), infections (43% vs 25%), abdominal pain (35% vs 16%), anemia (29% vs 4%), leukopenia (28% vs 2%), decreased appetite (27% vs 12%), vomiting (26% vs 10%), headache (20% vs 15%), dysgeusia (18% vs 3%), thrombocytopenia (16% vs 3%), alopecia (16% vs 2%), stomatitis (15% vs 10%), ALT increased (13% vs 5%), pruritus (13% vs 6%), cough (13% vs 11%), dizziness (12% vs 6%), AST increased (12% vs 7%), peripheral edema (12% vs 7%), creatinine increased (12% vs <1%), rash (11% vs 4%), pyrexia (11% vs 6%), and weight decreased (10% vs 2%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades , ≥10%) observed in MONARCH 1 with Verzenio were diarrhea (90%), fatigue (65%), nausea (64%), decreased appetite (45%), abdominal pain (39%), neutropenia (37%), vomiting (35%), infections (31%), anemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (20%), headache (20%), cough (19%), leukopenia (17%), constipation (17%), arthralgia (15%), dry mouth (14%), weight decreased (14%), stomatitis (14%), creatinine increased (13%), alopecia (12%), dysgeusia (12%), pyrexia (11%), dizziness (11%), and dehydration (10%). The most frequently reported ≥5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions that occurred in the Verzenio arm of MONARCH 2 were neutropenia (27% vs 2%), diarrhea (13% vs <1%), leukopenia (9% vs 0%), anemia (7% vs 1%), and infections (6% vs 3%). The most frequently reported ≥5% Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions from MONARCH 1 with Verzenio were neutropenia (24%), diarrhea (20%), fatigue (13%), infections (7%), leukopenia (6%), anemia (5%), and nausea (5%). Lab abnormalities (all grades; Grade 3 or 4) for MONARCH 2 in ≥10% for Verzenio plus fulvestrant and ≥2% higher than placebo plus fulvestrant were increased serum creatinine (98% vs 74%; 1% vs 0%), decreased white blood cells (90% vs 33%; 23% vs 1%), decreased neutrophil count (87% vs 30%; 33% vs 4%), anemia (84% vs 33%; 3% vs <1%), decreased lymphocyte count (63% vs 32%; 12% vs 2%), decreased platelet count (53% vs 15%; 2% vs 0%), increased ALT (41% vs 32%; 5% vs 1%), and increased AST (37% vs 25%; 4% vs 4%). Lab abnormalities (all grades; Grade 3 or 4) for MONARCH 1 with Verzenio were increased serum creatinine (98%; <1%), decreased white blood cells (91%; 28%), decreased neutrophil count (88%; 27%), anemia (68%; 0%), decreased lymphocyte count (42%; 14%), decreased platelet count (41%; 2%), increased ALT (31%; 3%), and increased AST (30%; 4%). Strong CYP3A inhibitors increased the exposure of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites to a clinically meaningful extent and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold. In patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the Verzenio dose to 100 mg twice daily with concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the Verzenio dose to 50 mg twice daily with concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient taking Verzenio discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the Verzenio dose (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the strong inhibitor. Patients should avoid grapefruit products. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents. Coadministration of Verzenio with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity. With severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), reduce the Verzenio dosing frequency to once daily. The pharmacokinetics of Verzenio in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min), end stage renal disease, or in patients on dialysis is unknown. No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic (Child-Pugh A or B) and/or renal impairment (CLcr ≥30-89 mL/min). Please see full Prescribing Information for Verzenio.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-361 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) did not meet its pre-specified dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS), compared with standard of care chemotherapy. In the final analysis of the study, there was an improvement in OS and PFS for patients treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin plus gemcitabine) compared to chemotherapy alone; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. The monotherapy arm of the study was not formally tested, since superiority was not reached for OS or PFS in the KEYTRUDA combination arm. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with previously reported studies, and no new safety signals were identified. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and will be discussed with regulatory authorities. “In this study, KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer was rigorously tested against an active control of the current standard of care chemotherapy combination regimen,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “While we are disappointed in these study results, KEYTRUDA has been established as an important option in the treatment of metastatic bladder cancer, and we are committed to continuing our research to help more patients with this disease. We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study.” KEYTRUDA has three FDA-approved bladder cancer indications across multiple types and stages of bladder cancer. Additionally, Merck has an extensive clinical development program in bladder cancer and is continuing to evaluate KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies across several disease settings (i.e., metastatic, muscle invasive bladder cancer, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer). About KEYNOTE-361 KEYNOTE-361 ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02853305 ) is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, the current standard of care, for the first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The dual primary endpoints are OS and PFS. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, disease control rate, overall response rate and safety. The study enrolled 1,010 patients who were randomized to receive: KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles); plus cisplatin (70 mg/m 2 IV) or carboplatin (AUC 5 IV or AUC 4.5 IV if required per local guidelines) on Day 1 or Day 2 of each three-week cycle; plus gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m 2 IV) on Day 1 and Day 8 of each three-week cycle; or KEYTRUDA monotherapy (200 mg IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to 35 cycles); or Cisplatin (70 mg/m 2 IV) or carboplatin (AUC 5 IV or AUC 4.5 IV if required per local guidelines) on Day 1 or Day 2 of each three-week cycle; plus gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m 2 IV) on Day 1 and Day 8 of each three-week cycle. About Bladder Cancer Bladder cancer begins when cells in the urinary bladder start to grow uncontrollably. As more cancer cells develop, they can form a tumor and spread to other areas of the body. Urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer, starts in the urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder. It is estimated there were more than 549,000 new cases of bladder cancer and nearly 200,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2018. In the United States, it is estimated there will be more than 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer and nearly 18,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. The five-year survival rate for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer (stage IV) is estimated to be approximately 5%. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,200 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients with various cancers receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%). Pneumonitis occurred in 8.2% (65/790) of NSCLC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 3.2% of patients, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (17%) compared to those without (7.7%). Pneumonitis occurred in 6% (18/300) of HNSCC patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-5 in 1.6% of patients, and occurred in 5.4% (15/276) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum and FU as first-line therapy for advanced disease, including Grades 3-5 in 1.5% of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis (KEYTRUDA) and Hepatotoxicity (KEYTRUDA in Combination With Axitinib) Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%). Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hepatotoxicity in Combination With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies KEYTRUDA can cause adrenal insufficiency (primary and secondary), hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 8.5% (237/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%). The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC (16%) receiving KEYTRUDA, as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%), and thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%). Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism), thyroid function (prior to and periodically during treatment), and hyperglycemia. For adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis and withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or Grade 4 adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis. Administer hormone replacement for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-Mediated Nephritis and Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 1.7% (7/405) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Immune-Mediated Skin Reactions Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue in patients receiving KEYTRUDA and may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis, and encephalitis. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after KEYTRUDA, 6 (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (1 fatal case) and 2 (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning (1 fatal case). Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and other immune-mediated adverse reactions. In patients with a history of allogeneic HSCT, acute GVHD (including fatal GVHD) has been reported after treatment with KEYTRUDA. Patients who experienced GVHD after their transplant procedure may be at increased risk for GVHD after KEYTRUDA. Consider the benefit of KEYTRUDA vs the risk of GVHD in these patients. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-412 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by KEYTRUDA as maintenance therapy (the KEYTRUDA regimen), did not meet its primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS) for the treatment of patients with unresected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). At the final analysis of the study, there was an improvement in EFS for patients who received the KEYTRUDA regimen compared to placebo plus CRT; however, these results did not meet statistical significance per the pre-specified statistical plan. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with previously reported studies in HNSCC. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. “There have been limited advances for patients with locally advanced HNSCC, and unfortunately, these results suggest that this disease remains very challenging to treat,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We are proud of the significant role KEYTRUDA plays in the treatment of certain later stages of HNSCC, and we are committed to investigating KEYTRUDA-based regimens for this debilitating type of cancer in earlier stages of disease. We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation in this study.” KEYTRUDA is currently approved as monotherapy and in combination regimens for appropriate patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan and other countries around the world. Merck currently has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program in HNSCC and is continuing to advance multiple registration-enabling studies investigating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines, including KEYNOTE-689 for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of resectable locally advanced HNSCC. About KEYNOTE-412 KEYNOTE-412 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03040999 ) evaluating KEYTRUDA with concurrent CRT, followed by KEYTRUDA as maintenance therapy for the treatment of patients with unresected locally advanced HNSCC. The primary endpoint was EFS, and the secondary endpoints included overall survival and safety. The trial enrolled an estimated 780 newly diagnosed adults with oropharyngeal or larynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks) in combination with CRT (cisplatin plus radiation), followed by KEYTRUDA as maintenance therapy for approximately one year, or placebo plus cisplatin and CRT, followed by placebo. About head and neck cancer Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the flat, squamous cells that make up the thin surface layer of the structures in the head and neck. There are several factors that greatly increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer, including tobacco and alcohol use and human papillomavirus (HPV). It is estimated there were more than 930,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 465,000 deaths from the disease in 2020 globally. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be more than 66,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and more than 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2022. About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,700 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers. Selected KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer KEYTRUDA, in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU), is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1 [Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1] as determined by an FDA-approved test. KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA With Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection. Infusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Embryofetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

(NASDAQ: Sage) and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced topline results from the Phase 2 KINETIC 2 dose-range study of the oral investigational drug SAGE-324 (BIIB124) as a potential treatment in essential tremor (ET). The KINETIC 2 Study did not demonstrate a statistically significant dose-response relationship in change from baseline to Day 91 based on the primary endpoint, The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) Performance Subscale (PS) Item 4 (upper limb) total score, in participants with ET. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences demonstrated for any dose of SAGE-324 versus placebo in the change from baseline to Day 91 on the TETRAS PS Item 4 Total Score or the TETRAS Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Composite Score. Given these results, Sage and Biogen will close the ongoing open label safety study of SAGE-324 in ET and do not plan to conduct further clinical development of SAGE-324 in ET. The companies are evaluating next steps, if any, for other potential indications. “There has been little innovation in the pharmacological treatment of essential tremor over the past 50 years, and people living with this debilitating condition have a pressing need for new treatment options. We are disappointed that the results of the KINETIC 2 Study do not support further development of SAGE-324 in ET. We are grateful to the essential tremor community and study investigators for their contributions to this research,” said Laura Gault, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Sage Therapeutics. “As always, Sage remains steadfast in our work to develop new treatments for people suffering from brain health conditions.” “We wish to thank the study participants and investigators who made this important research possible. While we share in their disappointment, we believe that the findings add to the collective understanding of this debilitating condition and may help inform the field on potential future research and therapeutic approaches,” said Katherine Dawson, MD, Head of Therapeutics Development Unit, Biogen. KINETIC 2 Study Results The KINETIC 2 Study was designed to evaluate the dose-response relationship of different doses of SAGE-324 on upper limb tremor. The study also evaluated the safety and tolerability of SAGE-324. The primary outcome measure was TETRAS PS Item 4 Total Score at Day 91, and the primary analysis assessed the dose-response relationship across SAGE-324 doses on this measure. Additional analyses evaluated the change from baseline to Day 91 on the TETRAS PS Item 4 Total Score and the secondary endpoint, TETRAS ADL Composite Score, for each dose of SAGE-324 versus placebo. In the study, 147 participants (129 monotherapy and 18 adjunct therapy, on a stable dose of propranolol prior to and during the study) were randomized in approximately equal proportions to placebo, 15 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg (with uptitration) for a three-month treatment period. SAGE-324 did not demonstrate a statistically significant dose-response relationship on the primary endpoint in participants with ET. No statistically significant differences were demonstrated between any dose of SAGE-324 and placebo in the change from baseline at Day 91 on the TETRAS PS Item 4 Total Score or TETRAS ADL Composite Score. Overall, there was a dose-relationship observed in the incidence of CNS depressant treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and in the frequency of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. The most common TEAEs reported in any treatment group were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, feeling abnormal, headache, and balance disorder. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. About SAGE-324 / BIIB124 SAGE-324 is an investigational oral neuroactive steroid (NAS) GABA A receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM). NAS GABA A receptor PAMs bind to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors, enhancing inhibitory activity of the GABAergic system, the major inhibitory neurotransmission system in the brain. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and plays a critical role in maintaining balanced neuronal activity in the brain. GABA dysregulation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ET. The safety and effectiveness of SAGE-324 have not been established.

(Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced topline results from the Phase 3 STAR study of timrepigene emparvovec (BIIB111/AAV2-REP1), an investigational gene therapy for the potential treatment of choroideremia. The STAR study did not meet its primary endpoint of proportion of participants with a ≥15 letter improvement from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at Month 12, in the interventional group in comparison to the non-interventional control group, as measured by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. In addition, the study did not demonstrate efficacy on key secondary endpoints. Safety results from the Phase 3 STAR study were consistent with previous studies. “We extend our deepest gratitude to all those who contributed to the STAR study, including the participants, investigators, site staff and the broader choroideremia community,” said Katherine Dawson, M.D., head of the Therapeutics Development Unit at Biogen. “While we are disappointed by the results of the STAR study, we are hopeful that the clinical insights gleaned from this study may help to shape therapeutic innovation for inherited retinal diseases including choroideremia, so that in the future there may be treatment options for the community affected by these debilitating disorders.” Biogen will evaluate the complete data set before confirming next steps for the timrepigene emparvovec clinical development program. Detailed results of this study will be made available at a future scientific forum. About timrepigene emparvovec (BIIB111/AAV2-REP1) Timrepigene emparvovec is an investigational recombinant AAV2 vector designed to deliver a functional version of the human choroideremia gene into the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells that aims to address the underlying genetic cause of choroideremia. About the STAR Phase 3 Study (NCT03496012) STAR was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, three-arm, parallel-controlled group study that enrolled 169 adult males with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of choroideremia. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single subretinal injection of investigational timrepigene emparvovec. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months post-treatment as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart. While the Phase 3 STAR study did not meet its primary endpoint, more information about the study is available here: www.clinicaltrials.gov . About Choroideremia Choroideremia is a rare, inherited retinal disease resulting in progressive vision loss, ultimately leading to blindness. Choroideremia is an X-linked recessive chorioretinal disease that is caused by loss of function mutations in the choroideremia gene resulting in decreased Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1) expression which leads to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors and choroid. Initially, patients with choroideremia experience poor night vision and over time, slow, progressive visual loss ultimately leads to blindness. Visual impairments due to choroideremia are associated with emotional, functional and economic burden. About Biogen At Biogen, our mission is clear: we are pioneers in neuroscience.

The trial data, however, showed potentially clinically meaningful improvements in both PFS and OS in pre-specified subgroups of patients based on the baseline inflammatory biomarker, hs-CRP, as well as other biomarker-defined subgroups. These data support further evaluation of canakunimab in lung cancer. “CANOPY-1 provides critical insights into the treatment of this devastating disease, and we will continue to analyze the data and conclusions, as well as their potential clinical implications,” said John Tsai, MD, Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, Novartis. “While this trial did not confirm the benefit for all patients we hoped for, we are energized by the overall CANOPY-1 findings as they support our commitment to continue studying canakinumab in lung cancer. We share our gratitude and thanks to the CANOPY-1 study patients and clinical investigators for their partnership.” Novartis and investigators are collaborating on further data analysis and will present the full dataset at an upcoming medical meeting. The company is continuing with the evaluation of canakinumab in lung cancer, and is applying findings to the overall lung cancer development plan. The comprehensive CANOPY clinical trial program continues with CANOPY-A, a Phase III study investigating canakinumab as an adjuvant therapy (after surgery) 2 , and CANOPY-N, a Phase II study in the neoadjuvant setting (before surgery) 5 . Enrollment for both trials is ongoing 2, 5 . Patients in the CANOPY-A trial more closely reflect the earlier CANTOS study population than those in the CANOPY-1 trial 2 , 3 , 4 . CANTOS was the first study to show that blocking the IL-1β inflammatory signal may potentially reduce lung cancer’s incidence and mortality 3 . Canakinumab is a potential first-in-class interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) inhibitor of the Pro-Tumor Inflammation (PTI) pathway in NSCLC 6 . PTI, which enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses, is one of the potential hallmarks of cancer and targets in NSCLC 3 , 6 . Novartis is developing other potential PTI pathway inhibitors, which are at various stages of development, including gevokizumab 7 , 8 . About canakinumab (ACZ885) Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and selectivity to human interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and neutralizes IL-1β activity by blocking its interaction with its receptors 9 , 10 . By neutralizing IL-1β, preliminary evidence suggests that canakinumab may inhibit Pro-Tumor Inflammation (PTI) to 1) enhance anti-tumor immune response; 2) reduce tumor cell proliferation, survival, and invasiveness; and 3) impair angiogenesis 11 . PTI enables tumor development by driving cancer-causing processes and suppressing anti-tumor immune responses 3 , 6 . Canakinumab is a potential first-in-class IL-1β inhibitor of the PTI pathway in NSCLC 6 . About the CANOPY program Novartis launched the CANOPY study program after observing significantly lower than expected rates of lung cancer mortality among patients in the Phase III cardiovascular CANTOS trial. The CANTOS trial evaluated canakinumab as a secondary prevention measure for cardiovascular events in patients following a heart attack 3 , 11 . Patients in the CANTOS trial also were at high risk for inflammatory cancers, like lung cancer, due to advanced age, smoking history, and other clinical risk factors 3 , 11 . Based on these findings, Novartis launched three large-scale, randomized, Phase III clinical trials and a Phase II clinical trial to investigate canakinumab as a potential treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CANOPY-A (NCT03447769 ) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial studying canakinumab in the adjuvant setting following surgical resection and cisplatin-based chemotherapy, if required 2 . The adjuvant study is designed to determine if treatment with canakinumab can prevent cancer relapse 2 . CANOPY-N (NCT03968419 ) is a Phase II neoadjuvant trial evaluating canakinumab either as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab among patients with resectable NSCLC prior to their planned surgery 5 . CANOPY-1 (NCT03631199) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial evaluating canakinumab as a first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy 4 . As reported today, the trial did not met its primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 1 . CANOPY-2 (NCT03626545 ) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial investigating the role of canakinumab in combination with the chemotherapy agent docetaxel in second- or third-line therapy versus docetaxel alone in NSCLC 12 . In March 2021, Novartis announced that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, and data were presented at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2021 Congress 13 . Novartis and lung cancer Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for more than 2 million new cases diagnosed each year 14 . More people die of lung cancer every year than any other cancer 14 . There are two main types of lung cancer—small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 15 . NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses 14 , 16 . Novartis is committed to working with the scientific and medical communities to reimagine the treatment of lung cancer and pursue advances in medicine that could extend the survival of people living with lung cancer. With one of the most diverse lung cancer development programs in the industry, Novartis is: developing experimental therapies that block cancer growth; learning more about ways to activate the body’s immune system; increasing understanding of the relationship between chronic inflammation and tumor growth and progression; and exploring the potential for advanced nuclear medicine to fight the disease. As part of this continuing and broad commitment to targeting lung cancer, data from CANOPY-1 will be evaluated and used to inform canakinumab’s future development program, including potential combination studies with tislelizumab.

The SEQUOIA trial did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. The most common Grade 3/4 adverse events occurring at a higher rate ( > 5% difference) on the pegilodecakin-plus-FOLFOX arm compared to the FOLFOX arm were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue and anemia. Detailed efficacy and safety results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting. Metastatic pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest major cancers, with just three percent of patients in the U.S. living five years after the cancer is diagnosed. In the U.S., pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the next decade. 1 Globally, pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related death. 2 ""More than 56,700 Americans – mothers, daughters, fathers, sons, colleagues and friends – will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year alone,"" said Julie Fleshman , JD, MBA, president and CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN). ""Because this is an aggressive disease and the current scope of treatment options is limited, there remains an urgent need for meaningful solutions to improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients."" ""Pancreatic cancer has proven to be one of the most difficult tumor types to treat and there have been very few recent treatment advancements in the later-line metastatic setting. We are grateful to the patients, investigators and researchers who participated in the study,"" said Maura Dickler , M.D., vice president, late phase development, Lilly Oncology. ""While we are disappointed by the outcome of the SEQUOIA study, we look forward to the upcoming results in lung cancer, learning from those results and increasing our understanding of pegilodecakin's novel mechanism of action in cancer immunotherapy."" Lilly gained pegilodecakin with the acquisition of ARMO BioSciences in June 2018 . SEQUOIA was initiated by ARMO in March 2017 based on results of the Phase 1/ 1b IVY study , which evaluated pegilodecakin – used as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and with checkpoint inhibitor therapy – across multiple tumor types including pancreatic, non-small cell lung and renal cell cancers. Results from the IVY trial were also the basis for the ongoing Phase 2 CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2 studies of pegilodecakin in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The CYPRESS studies were initiated by ARMO in March 2018 and results, expected in early 2020, will inform future studies of pegilodecakin in NSCLC. For the next stage of pegilodecakin's clinical development, Lilly is focused on assessing biomarkers and conducting studies in NSCLC and other tumor types including renal cell carcinoma, where the molecule has shown promising activity. Notes to Editors About SEQUOIA SEQUOIA is a global, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of pegilodecakin in combination with FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-FU, oxaliplatin) compared to FOLFOX alone in participants with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas whose disease had progressed on one prior gemcitabine-containing regimen. The primary endpoint of the study is overall survival and key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival and objective response rate. SEQUOIA was initiated by ARMO BioSciences in March 2017 and enrolled 567 patients. About Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest major cancers, with just three percent of patients in the U.S. living five years after the cancer is diagnosed. In the U.S., pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death and is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the next decade. 1 Globally, pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related death. 2 About Pegilodecakin Pegilodecakin is an immunotherapy which stimulates the body's natural defenses against cancer and expands tumor-attacking T cells. This class of T cells can infiltrate and destroy cancer cells. Pegilodecakin, a pegylated IL-10, has shown clinical activity as a single agent in renal cancer and promising results in combination with both chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy across several tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma.

The OVERCOME study aims to further understand the burden of migraine and stigma experienced by people living with the disease, identify barriers to the appropriate treatment of migraine and assess how the introduction of novel treatment options may influence delivery of migraine care and outcomes. The results were shared during the American Headache Society's 2020 Virtual Annual Scientific Meeting. ""For millions of people living with migraine, the journey to an appropriate treatment program is fraught with gaps,"" said Susan Hutchinson , M.D., Orange County Migraine and Headache Center, Irvine, CA and scientific advisor to the OVERCOME study. ""There are a variety of reasons at play, but it begins with the fact that many may not realize what they are experiencing is a migraine and not just 'another bad headache.' By increasing understanding of this disease, both among the public and with healthcare providers, we can improve the chances a person living with migraine will take the important step of receiving a diagnosis and ultimately, receive appropriate treatment."" Using data from OVERCOME, the authors assessed the proportion of people living with migraine and migraine-related disability - as measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) - who completed three critical steps in migraine management: 1) actively sought care with a healthcare professional, 2) received a migraine diagnosis, and 3) took a recommended prescription medication 1 . The objectives were to assess how many respondents completed each step and to understand migraine-related characteristics such as migraine pain severity and related disability, sociodemographic features and where respondents sought care for their migraine. Among OVERCOME respondents with migraine who may benefit from acute prescription medication and experienced at least mild migraine-related disability (MIDAS>6) (n=12,212), 63 percent sought care (n=7,695) and of those, 75 percent were diagnosed with migraine (n=5,802). Within the diagnosed population, only 59 percent took a recommended acute prescription medication (n=3,401). Overall, only 28 percent of the population completed all three steps to appropriate care. Among OVERCOME respondents who were candidates for a preventive medication (n=5,873), which includes people who experienced four or more migraine headache days per month and moderate or severe migraine-related disability (MIDAS >11), 69 percent sought care (n=4,053) and of those, 79 percent received a migraine diagnosis (n=3,218). Of those who sought care and received a diagnosis, only 28 percent took a preventive medication for migraine (n=902). Overall, only 15 percent of this population completed all three steps to appropriate care. ""Even in light of recent new treatment options in the field of migraine, we still face an uphill battle as too many continue to be underserved,"" said Robert E. Shapiro , M.D., Department of Neurological Sciences, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont and scientific advisor to the OVERCOME study. ""An important aspect of migraine care that is truly diminished and may contribute to these findings is the stigma felt by many living with the disease. A person's reluctance to seek care or take medication for their migraine can be rooted in the fear of how a friend, employer, or even a loved one may view them for doing so."" For both populations, possessing health insurance and higher levels of migraine-related disability increased the likelihood that respondents would complete all three steps. Another common theme across both populations was approximately 10 percent of respondents sought care in an emergency room, urgent care or retail clinic setting only and as a result, were unlikely to receive an accurate diagnosis or take a recommended medication. ""The OVERCOME study provides a snapshot into the current state of migraine in America, while reminding us there is much work to be done,"" said Eric Pearlman , M.D., Ph.D., senior medical director, U.S. neuroscience, Eli Lilly and Company. ""We are in a golden era for migraine care with the introduction of new therapeutic options for both the acute and preventive treatment of the disease, but if we don't address the need for better education, less stigma and improved access to care, we are falling short."" About the OVERCOME Study The O bser v ational Survey of the E pidemiology, T r eatment and C are o f M igrain e (OVERCOME) study aims to further understand the burden of migraine and stigma experienced by people living with the disease, identify barriers to the appropriate treatment of migraine and assess how the introduction of novel treatment options may influence delivery of migraine care and outcomes. The OVERCOME study is a prospective, web-based patient survey designed to follow U.S. population samples with migraine for two years following their enrollment. The first population sample of 21,143 began enrollment in 2018. In parallel to this population sample, the OVERCOME study also included 10,000 people who did not have migraine, providing a unique perspective about how migraine is perceived by those who do not have the disease. The second population sample of 20,782 with migraine was initiated in late 2019.

Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population of a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with cediranib in combination with LYNPARZA vs. platinum-based chemotherapy. Cediranib is an investigational oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, which blocks the growth of blood vessels supporting tumor growth. Dr. Jose Baselga, executive vice president, oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, said, “Despite these disappointing results, we remain committed to expanding on the benefits already demonstrated with LYNPARZA for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We will work closely with NRG Oncology and the NCI to review the full results to inform our ongoing research.” Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, “Ovarian cancer is one of the most difficult tumors to diagnose and treat early. AstraZeneca, Merck and our partners will continue to explore ways to help patients through our joint clinical trial development program.” The safety and tolerability profiles observed in GY004 were generally consistent with those known for each medicine. The NCI and NRG Oncology will present the full data at a forthcoming medical meeting. About GY004 GY004 is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 study testing the efficacy and safety of investigational medicine cediranib and LYNPARZA or LYNPARZA alone vs. standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients. The study enrolled patients with or without a BRCA mutation. The study had a hierarchical statistical testing scheme which precluded formally testing LYNPARZA vs. chemotherapy based on the results of the cedarinib and LYNPARZA arm. The GY004 trial is led by NRG Oncology, a non-profit research organization funded by the NCI, in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health. AstraZeneca provided both cediranib and LYNPARZA to support the trial through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR LYNPARZA CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no contraindications for LYNPARZA. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in <1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The duration of therapy in patients who developed secondary MDS/AML varied from <6 months to >2 years. All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy, and some also had a history of more than one primary malignancy or of bone marrow dysplasia. Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery. If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed. Pneumonitis: Occurred in <1% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm. A pregnancy test is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment. Females Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose. Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of LYNPARZA and to not donate sperm during this time.

DRUG INTERACTIONS Anticancer Agents: Clinical studies of LYNPARZA in combination with other myelosuppressive anticancer agents, including DNA-damaging agents, indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity. CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be co-administered, reduce the dose of LYNPARZA. Advise patients to avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, and Seville orange juice during LYNPARZA treatment. CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers when using LYNPARZA. If a moderate inducer cannot be avoided, there is a potential for decreased efficacy of LYNPARZA. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: No data are available regarding the presence of olaparib in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with LYNPARZA and for 1 month after receiving the final dose. Pediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of LYNPARZA have not been established in pediatric patients. Hepatic Impairment: No adjustment to the starting dose is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A and B). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification C). Renal Impairment: No adjustment to the starting dose is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr=51-80 mL/min) but patients should be monitored closely for toxicity. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr=31-50 mL/min), reduce the dose to 200 mg twice daily. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (CLcr ≤30 mL/min).

About Ovarian Cancer Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. In 2018, there were nearly 300,000 new cases diagnosed and around 185,000 deaths. Most women are diagnosed with advanced (Stage III or IV) ovarian cancer and have a five-year survival rate of approximately 30%. About LYNPARZA ® (olaparib) LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR. LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad and advanced clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types. About the AstraZeneca and Merck Strategic Oncology Collaboration In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, US, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, and potential new medicine selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop LYNPARZA and selumetinib in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop LYNPARZA and selumetinib in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.

In both trials, there was no significant change from baseline to week 12 in exercise ability with Jardiance versus placebo, as measured by the six-minute walk test, which was the primary endpoint of the studies. The safety profile seen in the EMPERIAL trials was similar to the currently known safety profile of Jardiance and no new safety risks were identified. The EMPERIAL trials, which included people with and without diabetes, deliver novel safety data for Jardiance in non-diabetic patients with heart failure. In addition, EMPERIAL-Preserved is the first trial to deliver safety data for Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. ""Our large heart failure clinical program underscores our dedication to researching new options for people living with this condition,"" said Mohamed Eid , M.D., M.P.H., M.H.A., vice president, Clinical Development & Medical Affairs, Cardio-Metabolism & Respiratory Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ""The EMPERIAL trials set a high bar for Jardiance to demonstrate an improvement in exercise ability in people with chronic heart failure, and we continue to believe in its potential to improve clinical outcomes. The ongoing EMPEROR trials—which are investigating outcomes including cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure and quality of life—remain the cornerstone of our heart failure program, and we look forward to sharing initial results in 2020."" The EMPERIAL trials used the six-minute walk test, which measures the distance a person can walk in six minutes, to evaluate changes in exercise ability over 12 weeks. For other heart failure guideline-recommended therapies, there have been divergent results between studies examining clinical outcomes and symptom improvement, with some showing improvements in outcomes such as mortality, but neutral or inconsistent results in exercise ability and patient-reported outcomes. The ongoing empagliflozin heart failure program also includes the EMPEROR-Preserved, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPULSE and EMPA-VISION studies. The program, which will include more than 10,000 adults, investigates the effects of empagliflozin on heart failure-related outcomes and patient-related outcomes in people with heart failure. The EMPERIAL studies were initiated based on data obtained from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial, in which Jardiance showed a 38% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death and a 35% relative risk reduction in hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, compared to placebo. ""The EMPERIAL trials highlight our commitment to listening to patients' needs and studying the impact of our treatments on important measures such as quality of life,"" said Jeff Emmick , M.D., Ph.D., vice president, Product Development, Lilly. ""Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly will continue to explore how Jardiance can potentially improve health outcomes and fill treatment gaps for people with cardiorenal metabolic conditions, including adults with chronic heart failure."" Full results from the EMPERIAL trials will be shared in 2020. About EMPERIAL EMPERIAL consisted of two Phase III randomized, double-blind trials in adults with or without diabetes. The trials evaluated the effect of 12 weeks' treatment of once-daily Jardiance 10 mg compared with placebo on exercise ability and heart failure symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction.* The primary endpoint was measured by the six-minute walk test, a common measure of exercise ability. EMPERIAL-preserved [ NCT03448406 ]: investigated Jardiance in patients with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The study looked at a functional endpoint — how far patients can walk in six minutes — and at heart failure symptoms. Primary endpoint: Change from baseline to week 12 in exercise ability as measured by the distance walked in six minutes Number of patients enrolled: 315 Completed: October 9, 2019 EMPERIAL-reduced [ NCT03448419 ]: investigated Jardiance in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The study looked at a functional endpoint — how far patients can walk in six minutes — and at heart failure symptoms. Primary endpoint: Change from baseline to week 12 in exercise ability as measured by the distance walked in six minutes Number of patients enrolled: 312 Completed: October 7, 2019 * Ejection fraction is a measurement expressed as a percentage of the amount of blood that leaves the heart each time it contracts, related to the total blood volume of the heart chambers. During each heartbeat pumping cycle, the heart contracts and relaxes. When the heart contracts, it ejects blood from the two pumping chambers (ventricles). When the heart relaxes, the ventricles refill with blood. HFpEF occurs when the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricle muscles are stiff. They do not relax as they should when the ventricle fills with blood, so less blood can enter the heart compared to a normally functioning heart. HFrEF occurs when the heart muscle does not contract effectively and less blood is pumped out to the body compared to a normally functioning heart. Both HFpEF and HFrEF lead to similar symptoms of heart failure, specifically difficulty breathing, swelling and fatigue. About Heart Failure Heart failure is a progressive, debilitating and potentially fatal condition that occurs when the heart cannot supply adequate circulation to meet the body's demands for oxygenated blood or, to do so, requires increased blood volume leading to fluid accumulation (congestion) in the lungs and peripheral tissues. It is a widespread condition affecting 60 million people worldwide and expected to increase as the population ages. Heart failure is highly prevalent in people with diabetes; however, approximately half of all people with heart failure do not have diabetes. Heart failure contributes to one in nine deaths and is a leading cause of hospitalization in the U.S. There is a high unmet need in the treatment of heart failure, as approximately 50 percent of people diagnosed with heart failure will die within five years. Additionally, heart failure represents the most common cause of hospitalization among individuals aged 65 years and over in the U.S. and Europe . About Cardiorenal Metabolic Conditions Cardiorenal metabolic conditions are a group of interconnected disorders affecting the heart, kidneys and endocrine system. In aggregate, these conditions are the leading cause of deaths worldwide, accounting for up to 20 million deaths annually. Conditions within this group include coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, among many others. Emerging science on the link between the cardiorenal and metabolic systems supports taking a multidisciplinary approach toward diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies for people living with these conditions. A team approach to optimize patient care by coordinating treatment of related comorbidities, including the use of emerging therapies with broad cardiorenal metabolic effects, may improve outcomes for people with serious chronic conditions such as these. What is JARDIANCE? ( www.jardiance.com ) JARDIANCE is a prescription medicine used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. JARDIANCE is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes who have known cardiovascular disease. JARDIANCE is not for people with type 1 diabetes or for people with diabetic ketoacidosis (increased ketones in the blood or urine). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Do not take JARDIANCE if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the ingredients in JARDIANCE. Do not take JARDIANCE if you have severe kidney problems or are on dialysis. JARDIANCE can cause serious side effects, including: Dehydration. JARDIANCE can cause some people to have dehydration (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, light-headed, or weak, especially when you stand up. You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you: have low blood pressure take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics) are on a low salt diet have kidney problems are 65 years of age or older. Vaginal yeast infection. Women who take JARDIANCE may get vaginal yeast infections. Talk to your doctor if you experience vaginal odor, white or yellowish vaginal discharge (discharge may be lumpy or look like cottage cheese), and/or vaginal itching. Yeast infection of the penis.

Additionally, progression free survival (PFS) in the PD-L1 positive population did not show statistical significance. The safety profile observed in KEYNOTE-061 was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of KEYTRUDA; no new safety signals were identified. In September 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KEYTRUDA as a third-line treatment for previously treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 1) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after two or more prior lines of therapy including fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy and if appropriate, HER2/neu-targeted therapy. The current indication remains unchanged and we continue to evaluate KEYTRUDA for gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma through KEYNOTE-062, a phase 3 clinical trial studying KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1 positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, and with KEYNOTE-585, a phase 3 trial studying KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in combination with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting. “We remain committed to the continued study of KEYTRUDA for gastric cancers and finding new options for patients facing this difficult-to-treat cancer type across various treatment settings,” said Dr. Roy Baynes, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “We want to thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this study and we look forward to sharing the full results from KEYNOTE-061, which will provide the medical community with important information about how patients with gastric cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 respond to treatment.” About KEYNOTE-061 KEYNOTE-061 is a randomized, open-label, pivotal phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02370498) investigating KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy versus paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma whose disease progressed after first-line treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy. The primary endpoints are PFS and OS in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS > 1); secondary endpoints include PFS, OS and Overall Response Rate (ORR) in patients regardless of PD-L1 expression. The study randomized 592 patients to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg fixed dose every three weeks) or paclitaxel [80 mg/m^2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle]. The study was designed to first evaluate efficacy in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1. If efficacy signals were observed and PFS and OS were positive in this subset of patients, further analysis was planned in the overall population. About Gastric Cancer Gastric cancer, also called stomach cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the stomach and tends to develop slowly over many years. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which develop from the cells of the innermost lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Risk factors for gastric cancer include gender, age, ethnicity, geography and infection with Helicobacter pylori . Worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. Each year there are approximately 952,000 newly diagnosed cases of gastric cancer resulting in approximately 723,000 deaths worldwide. It is estimated that in 2017, more than 10,000 people will die from gastric cancer in the U.S. alone. About KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) Injection 100 mg KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program, which currently involves more than 650 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient’s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases. Pneumonitis occurred in 94 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (1.3%), 3 (0.9%), 4 (0.3%), and 5 (0.1%) pneumonitis, and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation (6.9%) compared to those without (2.9%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis. Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.4%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.4%), and 4 (<0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause hypophysitis. Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (<0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. KEYTRUDA can cause thyroid disorders, including hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 96 (3.4%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.8%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (6.2%) and 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in patients with HNSCC, occurring in 28 (15%) of 192 patients with HNSCC, including Grade 3 (0.5%) hypothyroidism. Thyroiditis occurred in 16 (0.6%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%) thyroiditis. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. KEYTRUDA can cause type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer antihyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.1%), and 4 (<0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Immune-mediated rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some cases with fatal outcome), exfoliative dermatitis, and bullous pemphigoid, can occur. Monitor patients for suspected severe skin reactions and based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. For signs or symptoms of SJS or TEN, withhold KEYTRUDA and refer the patient for specialized care for assessment and treatment. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA can cause other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune-mediated reactions may occur in any organ system. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 2799 patients: arthritis (1.5%), uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. In addition, myelitis and myocarditis were reported in other clinical trials, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and postmarketing use. Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in postmarketing use of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Treatment with KEYTRUDA may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. Consider the benefit of treatment with KEYTRUDA vs the risk of possible organ rejection in these patients. KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 6 (0.2%) of 2799 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions, including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Immune-mediated complications, including fatal events, occurred in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after being treated with KEYTRUDA. Of 23 patients with cHL who proceeded to allogeneic HSCT after treatment with KEYTRUDA on any trial, 6 patients (26%) developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), one of which was fatal, and 2 patients (9%) developed severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced-intensity conditioning, one of which was fatal. Cases of fatal hyperacute GVHD after allogeneic HSCT have also been reported in patients with lymphoma who received a PD-1 receptor–blocking antibody before transplantation. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for early evidence of transplant-related complications such as hyperacute GVHD, severe (Grade 3 to 4) acute GVHD, steroid-requiring febrile syndrome, hepatic VOD, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions, and intervene promptly. In clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs ipilimumab were fatigue (28% vs 28%), diarrhea (26% with KEYTRUDA), rash (24% vs 23%), and nausea (21% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for ipilimumab only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA.

In KEYNOTE-012, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of 192 patients with HNSCC. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3 or 4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism. In KEYNOTE-087, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 5% of 210 patients with cHL, and treatment was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 26% of patients.

The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥1%) included pneumonia, pneumonitis, pyrexia, dyspnea, GVHD, and herpes zoster. Two patients died from causes other than disease progression; one from GVHD after subsequent allogeneic HSCT and one from septic shock. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (26%), pyrexia (24%), cough (24%), musculoskeletal pain (21%), diarrhea (20%), and rash (20%). In KEYNOTE-052, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The most common adverse reactions (in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue (38%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), decreased appetite (22%), constipation (21%), rash (21%), and diarrhea (20%). Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with KEYTRUDA experienced sepsis which led to death, and 3 patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of KEYTRUDA-treated patients, the most frequent (≥2%) of which were urinary tract infection, pneumonia, anemia, and pneumonitis. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with gastric cancer were similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC. The most common adverse reactions for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) (reported in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, rash, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, and constipation. It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. There is limited experience in pediatric patients. In a study, 40 pediatric patients (16 children aged 2 years to younger than 12 years and 24 adolescents aged 12 years to 18 years) with advanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1–positive advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients received KEYTRUDA for a median of 3 doses (range 1–17 doses), with 34 patients (85%) receiving KEYTRUDA for 2 doses or more. The safety profile in these pediatric patients was similar to that seen in adults treated with KEYTRUDA. Toxicities that occurred at a higher rate (≥15% difference) in these patients when compared to adults under 65 years of age were fatigue (45%), vomiting (38%), abdominal pain (28%), hypertransaminasemia (28%), and hyponatremia (18%).

Additional analyses of secondary endpoints and biomarkers are ongoing by Washington University and Lilly. Results will be presented at the Advances in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Therapies (AAT-AD/PD ™ ) Focus Meeting in April of 2020. At this time, Lilly does not plan to pursue a submission for solanezumab in people with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD), also known as autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, based on the result of the primary endpoint. This outcome does not impact the ongoing solanezumab Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) Study. ""We are grateful to the courageous participants, their families, and clinical investigators for their dedication to the study. We look forward to the opportunity to analyze the data so that we may continue to propel the science forward and bring hope to these patients,"" said Daniel Skovronsky , M.D., Ph.D., Lilly's chief scientific officer and president of Lilly Research Labs. ""Lilly is committed to finding treatments for patients and remains excited about the potential of our medicines under development in the area of Alzheimer's."" The DIAN-TU platform trial is a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The goal is to test potential disease-modifying therapies in individuals at risk for or with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease, which is caused by rare gene mutations. It began as a two-year biomarker target engagement study and evolved into a Phase 2/3 registration study with a primary cognitive outcome measure and a minimum of four years of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis included 50 solanezumab and 40 placebo participants. The minimum four-year treatment period was completed by 36 solanezumab and 32 placebo participants. The initial study dose was 400mg every four weeks. A late amendment to the study increased the dose resulting in approximately 25 percent of the total doses being administered at the 1600mg level. The DIAN-TU Study, which was established in 2010 and funded by Lilly, Roche and Genentech, National Institutes of Health, and other donors, is the first disease prevention trial to test investigational Alzheimer's disease compounds with different mechanisms of action from two pharmaceutical companies. The collaboration between Lilly, Washington University , Roche and Genentech combined research, resources, and expertise for a common goal of serving patients and their loved ones battling this devastating disease. ""Our first attempt to slow Alzheimer's before symptoms manifest is the result of the heroic commitment of patients and families at risk for dominantly inherited Alzheimer's, leading global academic researchers, the NIH, the Alzheimer's Association, philanthropic supporters, the DIAN-TU Pharma Consortium, government and regulatory colleagues, and pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are being tested,"" said principal investigator Randall J. Bateman , M.D., the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology and the director of DIAN-TU. ""It wouldn't have been possible without all stakeholders coming together for the cause to stop Alzheimer's disease."" For more than 30 years, Lilly has been committed to bringing innovative Alzheimer's disease therapies and diagnostics to patients and continues to lead the field in research, which also includes identifying biomarkers to support early detection of the disease.

News release details Blueprint Medicines Announces Top-line Results from Phase 3 VOYAGER Trial of Avapritinib versus Regorafenib in Patients with Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor April 28, 2020 at 7:00 AM EDT -- VOYAGER did not meet the primary endpoint of an improvement in progression-free survival for avapritinib versus regorafenib in patients with third- or fourth-line GIST -- -- Plan to continue to prioritize portfolio opportunities in systemic mastocytosis and RET-altered cancers, with multiple regulatory submissions anticipated in 2020 -- -- Continue to expect existing cash balance to fund operations into the second half of 2022 -- -- Blueprint Medicines to host investor conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET -- CAMBRIDGE, Mass. , April 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Blueprint Medicines Corporation (NASDAQ: BPMC), a precision therapy company focused on genomically defined cancers, rare diseases and cancer immunotherapy, today announced top-line results from the Phase 3 VOYAGER clinical trial of avapritinib versus regorafenib in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The VOYAGER trial did not meet the primary endpoint of an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for avapritinib versus regorafenib. Top-line safety data for avapritinib were consistent with those previously reported. Blueprint Medicines plans to continue to commercialize AYVAKIT™ (avapritinib) in the United States for the treatment of adults with unresectable or metastatic GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations, and seek marketing approval for avapritinib for the treatment of this patient population in additional geographies. Blueprint Medicines continues to anticipate a decision from the European Commission on its marketing authorization application for the treatment of adults with PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST in the third quarter of 2020. Based on the top-line VOYAGER data, the company plans to discontinue further development of avapritinib in GIST beyond PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST. ""While we are disappointed by the outcome of the VOYAGER trial, we are deeply grateful to the patients, investigators and clinical site staff who contributed to the completion of this global study. We hope these data will reveal important insights to improve the scientific understanding of the disease and inform future innovations in GIST, and we are committed to sharing the results at a future medical meeting,"" said Jeff Albers , Chief Executive Officer of Blueprint Medicines . ""At Blueprint Medicines, we strive to advance science, building on successes and learning from setbacks, to create new medicines for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers and rare diseases. With a deep portfolio of precision therapies and a strong financial position, we will continue to advance our pipeline with clear near-term priorities in systemic mastocytosis and RET-altered cancers."" Top-line Data from Phase 3 VOYAGER Trial The VOYAGER trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of avapritinib (N=240) versus regorafenib (N=236) in patients with third- or fourth-line GIST. Avapritinib showed a median PFS of 4.2 months compared to 5.6 months for regorafenib. The difference in median PFS between the avapritinib and regorafenib groups was not statistically significant. The overall response rate was 17 percent for the avapritinib group and 7 percent for the regorafenib group. Avapritinib was generally well-tolerated with most adverse events reported as Grade 1 or 2. Top-line safety results were consistent with previously reported data, and no new safety signals were observed. Additional analyses of the VOYAGER trial results are ongoing, and Blueprint Medicines plans to present the data at a future medical meeting. Financial Guidance Based on its current operating plans, Blueprint Medicines continues to expect that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investments together with anticipated product revenues but excluding any additional potential option fees, milestone payments or other payments under its collaboration or license agreements, will be sufficient to enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2022. Anticipated savings from the discontinuation of further development of avapritinib in non-PDGFRA exon 18 mutant GIST indications is expected to offset any previously forecast revenues from those indications through 2022. As of December 31, 2019 , Blueprint Medicines had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $548.0 million . In addition, Blueprint Medicines received $308.4 million in estimated net proceeds from its January 2020 follow-on public offering. Conference Call Information Blueprint Medicines will host a live webcast today beginning at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the top-line data from the VOYAGER trial. To access the live call, please dial (855) 728-4793 (domestic) or (503) 343-6666 (international), and refer to conference ID 2207088.

The Phase 3 MOVe-AHEAD trial evaluated people who did not have COVID-19 at baseline (confirmed by a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 test and no signs and symptoms) but lived with someone who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. In the primary endpoint of participants who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (confirmed by a negative SARS-CoV-2 test), the LAGEVRIO treated group was observed to be 23.6% less likely than those who received placebo to develop COVID-19 through Day 14 (a positive post-baseline SARS-CoV-2 test with evidence of signs and symptoms); the primary endpoint was not met. The safety profile of LAGEVRIO in this trial was generally consistent with that observed in previously reported clinical studies and post-authorization experience in the treatment of COVID-19. Merck intends to submit full results from this study for presentation at a scientific meeting or for publication. “Results from this post-exposure prevention study are scientifically interesting as we continue to learn more about COVID-19. We are grateful to the MOVe-AHEAD trial participants and investigators for their contributions to this study,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “This was not a treatment study and these results do not impact the efficacy and safety data observed in our Phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We remain focused on our ongoing efforts to bring LAGEVRIO as treatment to appropriate high-risk patients with COVID-19 where its use is authorized or approved, as well as to further study the ways it may benefit patients with other infectious diseases, such as RSV.” LAGEVRIO is approved or authorized in several markets including the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia, China and Japan, for the treatment of certain adults who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. See additional information on the authorized use of LAGEVRIO in the U.S. below. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. About the MOVe-AHEAD Study MOVe-AHEAD (MK-4482-013) ( NCT04939428 ) was a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) compared to placebo in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, within households. The trial enrolled over 1,500 participants who were randomized to receive either LAGEVRIO (800 mg) or placebo orally every 12 hours for five days. The study enrolled participants who were at least 18 years of age and resided in the same household with someone who received a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, had at least one sign or symptom of COVID-19 and had not had those signs and symptoms for more than five days. Participants were not eligible for the trial if they received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine more than seven days prior to enrollment, previously had COVID-19 within the past six months or were showing any signs or symptoms of COVID-19. The primary endpoints of the trial included percentage of participants who have undetectable SARS-CoV-2 in baseline nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and develop COVID-19 through Day 14, percentage of participants with an adverse event and percentage of participants who discontinued study intervention due to an adverse event. The trial was conducted globally in countries including Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Egypt, France, Guatemala, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Philippines, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States. About Merck’s Global Efforts to Accelerate Access to LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) Following Regulatory Authorizations or Approvals Global access has been a priority for Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, a biotechnology company focused on emerging infectious diseases, since the inception of their LAGEVRIO collaboration. The companies are committed to providing timely access to LAGEVRIO globally through our comprehensive supply and access approach, which includes: Supply: Patients around the world have received approximately 4 million courses of LAGEVRIO. Merck has supplied LAGEVRIO to more than 40 markets worldwide. Voluntary licenses: As part of its commitment to widespread global access, Merck granted voluntary licenses (VLs) to generic manufacturers and to the Medicines Patent Pool to make generic molnupiravir available in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies. Through our voluntary licensing agreements with generic manufacturers, more than 5 million courses of generic molnupiravir have been delivered to 22 markets through December 2022. Additionally, Hetero Labs, Ltd. has received WHO prequalification, an important step in enabling broader access to molnupiravir. UNICEF: To supplement the supply from licensed generic manufacturers and bridge to the availability of WHO prequalified generic supply, Merck entered into an agreement with UNICEF to allocate up to 3 million courses of LAGEVRIO to facilitate timely supply to low- and middle-income countries. Merck has also committed 2 million patient courses of LAGEVRIO, available to USAID at Merck’s best access price to increase access in lower-income countries. Product donation: Merck has donated 100,000 courses of therapy to Direct Relief, a global humanitarian aid organization, for distribution to refugees, including 50,000 courses of therapy for people affected by the invasion of Ukraine. Purchase and supply agreements: Merck entered into a procurement agreement with the U.S. government under which the company supplied approximately 3.1 million courses of LAGEVRIO to the U.S. government, upon Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has created a Test-to-Treat locator to help identify pharmacies and community health centers across the nation where people can get tested for COVID-19 and receive appropriate treatments, as needed. Merck has also entered into additional advance purchase and supply agreements for LAGEVRIO with governments of more than 40 markets worldwide and is currently in discussions with additional governments. Merck is implementing a tiered-pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria to reflect countries’ relative ability to finance their health response to the pandemic. Responding to global needs with urgency: In September 2022, Merck announced a cooperation framework agreement with Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd., under which Merck granted distribution and exclusive import rights for LAGEVRIO to Sinopharm following authorization. To date, we have shipped more than one million courses of LAGEVRIO to China, with additional shipments planned. Authorized Use of LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) in the U.S. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an EUA for the emergency use of the unapproved product LAGEVRIO, a nucleoside analogue that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by viral mutagenesis, for the treatment of adults with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate. LAGEVRIO is not FDA-approved for any use, including the treatment of COVID-19. The emergency use of LAGEVRIO is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1) unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment with LAGEVRIO has not been observed in subjects when treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use for longer than five consecutive days. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19. LAGEVRIO may only be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs in the therapeutic class to which LAGEVRIO belongs (i.e., anti-infectives). Selected Safety Information for LAGEVRIO Contraindications No contraindications have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO authorized under this EUA. Warnings and Precautions There are limited clinical data available for LAGEVRIO. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with LAGEVRIO use. LAGEVRIO is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAGEVRIO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant individuals. There are no available human data on the use of LAGEVRIO in pregnant individuals to evaluate the risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. LAGEVRIO is authorized to be prescribed to a pregnant individual only after the healthcare provider has determined that the benefits would outweigh the risks for that individual patient. If the decision is made to use LAGEVRIO during pregnancy, the prescribing healthcare provider must document that the known and potential benefits and the potential risks of using LAGEVRIO during pregnancy were communicated to the pregnant individual. There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO during pregnancy. The prescribing healthcare provider must document that a pregnant individual was made aware of the pregnancy registry at https://covid-pr.pregistry.com or 1-800-616-3791. Pregnant individuals exposed to LAGEVRIO or their healthcare providers can also report the exposure by contacting Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA at 1-877-888-4231. Advise individuals of childbearing potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. Prior to initiating treatment with LAGEVRIO, assess whether an individual of childbearing potential is pregnant or not, if clinically indicated. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with LAGEVRIO. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue LAGEVRIO and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care. LAGEVRIO is not authorized for use in patients less than 18 years of age because it may affect bone and cartilage growth. The safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO have not been established in pediatric patients. Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥1% of subjects in the LAGEVRIO treatment group in the Phase 3 double-blind MOVe-OUT study were diarrhea (2% versus placebo at 2%), nausea (1% versus placebo at 1%), and dizziness (1% versus placebo at 1%) all of which were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate). Serious adverse events occurred in 7% of subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 10% receiving placebo; most serious adverse events were COVID-19 related. Adverse events leading to death occurred in 2 (<1%) of the subjects receiving LAGEVRIO and 12 (2%) of subjects receiving placebo. Drug Interactions No drug interactions have been identified based on the limited available data on the emergency use of LAGEVRIO. No clinical drug-drug interaction trials of LAGEVRIO with concomitant medications, including other treatments for mild to moderate COVID-19, have been conducted. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding There are no data on the presence of molnupiravir or its metabolites in human milk. It is unknown whether molnupiravir has an effect on the breastfed infant or effects on milk production. Based on the potential for adverse reactions in the infant from LAGEVRIO, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with LAGEVRIO and for 4 days after the final dose. A lactating individual may consider interrupting breastfeeding and may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose of LAGEVRIO. Males of Reproductive Potential Nonclinical studies to fully assess the potential for LAGEVRIO to affect offspring of treated males have not been completed. Advise sexually active individuals with partners of childbearing potential to use a reliable method of contraception correctly and consistently during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO. The risk beyond three months after the last dose of LAGEVRIO is unknown. Required Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors The prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to LAGEVRIO within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event. Submit adverse event and medication error reports, using FDA Form 3500, to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods: Complete and submit the report online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm Complete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 ( https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download ) and return by: Mail to MedWatch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787, or Fax to 1-800-FDA-0178 or Call 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting form In addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ USA by: Fax: 215-616-5677 E-mail: dpoc.usa@merck.com About LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) LAGEVRIO (molnupiravir) (MK-4482) is an investigational, orally administered nucleoside analog that inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Merck and Ridgeback’s “orange COVID-19 pill” is a Swedish Orange opaque capsule with the Merck corporate logo and “82” printed in white ink, available in certain markets as LAGEVRIO. Molnupiravir was invented at Emory University. Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, which was formed by Emory to develop early-stage drug candidates for viral diseases of global concern, advanced molnupiravir through IND submission. Emory/DRIVE received some research funding from the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. LAGEVRIO is being developed by Merck in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Ridgeback received an upfront payment from Merck and also is eligible to receive contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. Any profits from the collaboration will be split between the partners equally. Since licensed by Ridgeback, all funds used for the development of LAGEVRIO have been provided by Merck and Ridgeback. LAGEVRIO was evaluated in MOVe-OUT, a global Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-site study of non-hospitalized adult patients with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. The Phase 3 portion of the MOVe-OUT trial was conducted globally in more than 170 sites in locations including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, France, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. For further information about the MOVe-OUT trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov . LAGEVRIO is being studied in other diseases beyond coronaviruses. Early work on additional programs has begun, and a study evaluating LAGEVRIO for RSV ( NCT05559905 ) is recruiting participants.

In addition, a Phase III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by year end 5 Basel, November 6 , 20 20 — Novartis today announced new data from an interim analysis for the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CAN-COVID trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 6 . The ongoing trial failed to meet its primary endpoint showing that treatment with canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) did not demonstrate a significantly greater chance of survival for patients without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, compared with placebo plus SoC up to Day 29 1 . The trial did not meet its key secondary endpoint of reducing the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after treatment 1 . The safety profiles of canakinumab plus SoC and placebo plus SoC were comparable 1 . “Though the CAN-COVID trial did not show the patient benefit we were hoping for, it helps improve the scientific understanding of COVID-19 and the role of interleukin-1β inhibition,” said John Tsai, M.D., Head of Global Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer for Novartis. “There’s still an urgent need for effective ways to combat COVID-19 and we will continue to apply our best scientific minds in support of the global pandemic response, including a Phase III trial of ruxolitinib. We’re deeply grateful to the patients who participated and their caregivers, as well as the healthcare professionals and hospital staff who made this research possible while fighting the pandemic on the front line.” In the trial, the primary endpoint of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation was 88.8% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 85.7% for placebo plus SoC ( P =0.29) 1 . The key secondary endpoint of COVID-19-related mortality up to 4 weeks was 4.9% for canakinumab plus SoC vs 7.2% for placebo plus SoC ( P =0.33) 1 . Both the primary and key secondary endpoints trended in favor of canakinumab but did not reach statistical significance 1 . No new safety signals for canakinumab were identified 1 . This interim analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks. The CAN-COVID results do not affect any other ongoing trials for canakinumab, including investigations for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 7-9 . As part of its continued efforts to support the global pandemic response, Novartis in October announced a collaboration with Switzerland-based Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin ® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19 4 . In addition, a Phase III trial for ruxolitinib in COVID-19 is ongoing, with preliminary results expected by year end 5 . About CAN-COVID CAN-COVID is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab plus standard of care (SoC) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 6 . Patients were hypoxic but not requiring intubation or invasive mechanical ventilation 6 . The primary endpoint was to demonstrate the benefit of canakinumab plus SoC vs placebo plus SoC in increasing the chance of survival without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation up to Day 29 6 . The key secondary endpoint was to reduce the COVID-19-related death rate during the 4-week period after trial treatment 6 . The trial enrolled 454 patients at multiple centers across the US, Russia and Europe 1 . Both endpoints were analyzed at Day 29 6 . The average age of trial participants was 58 years old, ranging from 18 to 98 years old 1 . Approximately 30% were Hispanic or Latino, 16% were Black or African American and 4% were Asian 1 . Interim analysis of Day 29 results is available. The trial is ongoing (to Day 127) with full results expected in early 2021 6 . About canakinumab Canakinumab is biologic medicine used in the treatment of a number of rare, debilitating auto-inflammatory diseases, for which there are limited options available. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), blocking its action 2, 3,10 . Excessive production of IL-1β plays a prominent role in certain inflammatory diseases and immune responses 1 1,12 . Canakinumab is an established medicine approved under the trade name Ilaris ® in approximately 60 countries including the US, Europe and others. It is indicated for rare conditions including periodic fever syndromes, adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) 2 ,3 . First approved in 2009, canakinumab has been proven to be highly effective and well tolerated as a treatment option for its approved indications based on previously reported clinical trials 2 ,3 . As well as being studied in severe COVID-19, canakinumab is also being investigated for the treatment of a number of other diseases involving inflammation, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 7 - 9 . Novartis response to COVID-19 p andemic Novartis is making multiple contributions to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and support the stability of global healthcare systems. The company has committed to donating USD 40 million to support communities around the world impacted by the pandemic. In addition, Novartis is active in several key cross-industry research initiatives, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, coordinated by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard as well as a COVID-19 directed partnership supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) 13 . Novartis has also announced a collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop two DARPin ® therapies designed for potential use against COVID-19, and the company is separately supporting COVID-19-related clinical investigations of several Novartis medicines 4 . We continue with the Phase III trial for ruxolitinib, another Novartis medicine, in collaboration with Incyte 5 . Preliminary results from this trial are expected by year end. Two medicines in early stage development are also being investigated focusing on stopping or slowing the body’s overactive immune response to COVID-19 14, 15 . In our labs, we have started a collaborative, longer-term drug discovery effort to develop an antiviral molecule to potentially treat all coronaviruses. To sustain access, the Novartis generics and biosimilars division Sandoz became the first company to commit to keeping stable prices for a basket of essential medicines that may help in the treatment of COVID-19 and entered into a partnership with US-based Civica Rx to support stable supply of essential generic hospital medicines. We are making 15 drugs that treat key symptoms of COVID-19 available to low- and lower-middle income countries at zero profit until a vaccine or curative treatment is found. This includes dexamethasone, which is the only medicine shown to decrease mortality so far in severe hospitalized COVID pneumonia 13 . Furthermore, Novartis Gene Therapies entered into a manufacturing agreement with Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts General Hospital to produce its novel genetic COVID-19 vaccine candidate called AAVCOVID 16 .

(Nasdaq:VTUS) today announced top line efficacy and safety results from the second Phase 3 clinical trial of Diltiazem Hydrochloride 2% Cream (VEN 307) in patients with pain related to anal fissure (AF). In this randomized double blind trial comparing diltiazem 2% cream versus placebo cream in 434 subjects in 90 centers globally, both treatment arms demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement. The diltiazem 2% treatment arm demonstrated no significant improvement compared to placebo in the primary endpoint of average of worst anal pain associated with or following defecation. The mean of worst AF-related pain score at baseline was 7.09 for diltiazem 2% and 7.18 for placebo, decreasing to 3.81 (-3.28 difference) and 3.72 (-3.46 difference) respectively. Outcomes for the secondary endpoints of overall AF-related pain and PGI-I parallel the primary endpoint. Age, gender, and race were equivalent between arms, and results were not meaningfully different between countries. Adverse events (AEs) were similar for the two treatment arms. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common with 20.7% of patients in the diltiazem 2% arm versus 21.9% in the placebo arm, substantially less than reported in the first Phase 3 trial. Reports of headaches were 5.1% for diltiazem 2% and 1.9% for placebo. There was one serious adverse event of pregnancy. In the first pivotal Phase 3 trial, the diltiazem 2% treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the primary endpoint of average of worst anal pain associated with or following defecation. The mean of worst AF-related pain score at baseline was 6.21 for diltiazem 2% and 6.38 for placebo, decreasing to 3.88 (-2.33 difference) and 4.35 (-2.03 difference) respectively (means not adjusted for baseline score). ""While this second study confirms a consistent effect in decreasing AF-related pain with diltiazem 2%, results among placebo patients are inconsistent across these two pivotal studies,"" said Dr. Russell Ellison , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ventrus Biosciences , Inc. ""Compounded diltiazem remains an important non-nitroglycerin treatment standard in this condition, yet this is an area which we believe may be more safely and reliably served by an FDA approved prescription pharmaceutical treatment. We look forward to discussing these results with the FDA ."" Inasmuch as a primary purpose of this second Phase 3 trial was to complete the safety data package for a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA , Ventrus will request a pre-NDA FDA meeting to determine next steps in the program. Because diltiazem is approved in oral formulations for the treatment of angina and high blood pressure, VEN 307 is eligible for the FDA's 505(b)2 registration pathway. About VEN 307: Diltiazem Hydrochloride Cream Diltiazem hydrochloride is a calcium-channel blocker that has been marketed in oral formulations for the treatment of angina and high blood pressure for over two decades. Diltiazem hydrochloride cream is applied perianally to treat pain related to anal fissure. It has been shown to normalize internal anal sphincter pressure and reduce anal maximal resting pressure, or MRP, and its vasodilator activity has the potential to improve blood supply, thereby decreasing the pain associated with anal fissures. About Anal Fissures Anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anal canal characterized by severe anal pain associated with or after bowel movements. It is a common anal disorder, which we believe is underdiagnosed. The pathogenesis of anal fissure is hypothesized to be initiated by the passage of a hard fecal bolus, resulting in a split in the epithelium of the anal canal. Along with poor vascular supply of the anal epithelium, increased activity (tone) of the internal anal sphincter smooth muscle further compromises the anodermal blood supply and contributes to the pain and ischemia of the anal epithelium, perpetuating ulceration and preventing healing. In 2010, it was estimated by SDI Health LLC that there were approximately 1.1 million office visits per year for anal fissures. Topical diltiazem, which is not approved by the FDA as a use for anal fissure, is currently listed in the U.S. anal fissure treatment guidelines as a preferred agent prior to attempting surgery, and is available only as a compounded medicine. About Ventrus Ventrus is a specialty pharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of prescription drugs addressing gastrointestinal problems. The Company's lead product is topical diltiazem (VEN 307) for the treatment of anal fissures. Ventrus' product candidate portfolio also includes topical phenylephrine (VEN 308) intended to treat fecal incontinence. The Company has also recently licensed intellectual property and know-how relating to the oral delivery of bacteria, viruses and drugs to specific sites in the intestine, using a pH sensitive controlled release platform technology. The potential indication areas include (i) gastro-intestinal, auto-immune and metabolic disorders, (ii) viral and bacterial vaccines, and (iii) optimized colonic delivery of drugs.

Seres Announces Preliminary SER-287 Phase 2b ECO-RESET Study Microbiome Data Analysis Dec 16, 2021 at 7:00 AM EST PDF Version – Microbiome data demonstrate the successful engraftment of SER-287 – – Microbiome assessments suggest potential for biomarker-based patient selection – – Company continues to evaluate SER-287 study data, and available preliminary SER-301 Phase 1b study clinical and microbiome data, to inform plans for continued development in ulcerative colitis – CAMBRIDGE, Mass. --(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 16, 2021-- Seres Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCRB), a leading microbiome therapeutics company, today announced preliminary microbiome data analyses from the Phase 2b ECO-RESET study evaluating SER-287 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). Following the topline clinical data readout in July, which noted that the SER-287 Phase 2b study did not achieve its primary endpoints, analysis of the microbiome data demonstrated the successful engraftment of SER-287 bacterial species. The Company continues to conduct analyses on its SER-287 and SER-301 UC clinical stage programs to inform next steps for further development. Based on the SER-287 Phase 2b microbiome data analyses, engraftment of SER-287 bacteria was statistically significant in patients receiving SER-287 versus placebo (p ≤ 0.001 at all timepoints). The magnitude and kinetics of engraftment were comparable to Seres’ Phase 1b study. However, unlike the Phase 1b study, anticipated changes in disease-relevant metabolites post-administration with SER-287 in the Phase 2b study were not observed. Analysis of the genomic and metabolomic data characterizing the microbiome of SER-287 study participants at baseline and post dosing suggest potential biomarkers for inclusion in future development efforts. UC is a biologically and clinically heterogeneous disease and the Company believes that a biomarker-based patient selection approach may enable future development to focus on individuals most amenable to a microbiome-based therapeutic intervention. “Our SER-287 Phase 2b data suggests that there may be an opportunity to utilize biomarker-based patient selection in our future UC development efforts. We continue to evaluate SER-287 study data, while also examining preliminary SER-301 Phase 1b study clinical and microbiome data, including analysis of changes in disease-relevant metabolites. We expect to provide a further update on these programs and our plans for future development in UC in the coming months,” said Eric Shaff , Chief Executive Officer at Seres.

(Nasdaq:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the formulation, development, and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced topline results from its Phase 2 clinical trial of OTX-CSI (cyclosporine intracanalicular insert) for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED). The Phase 2, U.S. -based, randomized, double-masked, multi-center, vehicle-controlled clinical trial of OTX-CSI was designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, durability, and efficacy of two different formulations of OTX-CSI by measuring signs and symptoms of DED in 140 subjects treated in both eyes over approximately 16 weeks (a 12-week study period, with an additional 4-week safety follow-up). In the Phase 2 clinical trial, OTX-CSI was administered to 147 subjects with DED at 15 sites in the U.S. The four groups evaluated in this study were: OTX-CSI for a shorter duration (2-3 months formulation-F1, n=42), OTX-CSI for a longer duration (3-4 months formulation-F2a, n=40), vehicle insert for a longer duration (3-4 months formulation-F2b, n=43) and vehicle insert for a very short duration (1 week formulation-F3, n=22). The study did not show separation between the OTX-CSI treated subjects (both formulations) and the vehicle treated subjects (both formulations) for the primary endpoint of increased tear production at 12 weeks as measured by the Schirmer’s Test. Change from baseline (improvement) in mean Schirmer’s Test scores for the four groups were as follows: OTX-CSI F1: 1.98 mm, OTX-CSI F2a: 1.91 mm, Vehicle F2b: 2.24 mm and Vehicle F3: 3.08 mm. The study did show an improvement compared with baseline in signs of dry eye disease as measured by total corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) and symptoms of dry eye disease as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) eye dryness in subjects treated with the OTX-CSI insert (both formulations) starting as early as two weeks after insertion and continuing over the 12 weeks study period. These improvements were not statistically significant compared with vehicle insert (both formulations) for either CFS or VAS eye dryness (severity and frequency) at 12 weeks. Overall, the OTX-CSI insert (both formulations) was generally observed to have a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. There were no ocular serious adverse events. No subjects dropped out of the trial due to an adverse event. The most common ocular adverse event was ocular pruritis which was seen in less than 16% of subjects. The adverse events of ocular discomfort or pain were seen in less than 3% of subjects. The most common non-ocular event was COVID-19 and was seen in 3% of subjects. “We would like to thank the patients and investigators who participated in the OTX-CSI clinical trial,” said Antony Mattessich , President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocular Therapeutix . “While we are disappointed by these results, demonstrating clinical benefit in patients with dry eye disease remains a significant unmet need and we will continue to review the data for additional information that may inform future development of this program. We remain confident in the potential of our hydrogel-based formulation technology and its ability to deliver innovative ophthalmology therapies. We look forward to our anticipated Phase 2 top-line read out for OTX-DED for the short-term treatment of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. In addition, we expect to provide updates on other pipeline programs being developed to treat glaucoma and wet-AMD as well as updates on our currently marketed product, DEXTENZA®, which recently received FDA approval to expand its label for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.” About Dry Eye Disease Dry eye disease is a common, multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort (such as burning sensation, itching, redness, stinging, pain and foreign body sensation), visual disturbance, and tear film instability that can cause potential damage to the ocular surface. Inflammation of the lacrimal gland and ocular surface have been shown to play a key role in dry eye disease, resulting in a reduction in tear production. Dry eye disease is one of the most common ophthalmic disorders presenting to clinicians and the Market Scope 2019 Dry Eye Products Market Report estimated that more than 17.2 million adults in the United States have been diagnosed with the disorder, including an estimated 8.6 million classified as having a moderate to severe form of the disease.

The proportion of patients who achieved red blood cell transfusion independence in the first 28 weeks was 47.5% for the roxadustat arm compared to 33.3% for placebo (p=0.217). The adverse event profile of roxadustat that was observed in the preliminary safety analysis was generally consistent with previous findings. Safety will be further evaluated at study completion. A total of one-hundred forty (140) patients were enrolled in MATTERHORN, a Phase 3, double-blind placebo-controlled study investigating the safety and efficacy of roxadustat for treatment of anemia in patients with lower risk transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes. The primary endpoint of the study is transfusion independence for ≥ 56 consecutive days during the first 28 weeks of treatment, and patients are followed for up to 52 weeks. The MATTERHORN study is sponsored and conducted by FibroGen and is part of FibroGen’s co-development collaborations with AstraZeneca and with Astellas Pharma Inc. About Myelodysplastic Syndromes Anemia Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of disorders characterized by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells, resulting in chronic anemia in most patients. Annual incidence rates of MDS are estimated to be 4.9/100,000 adults in the U.S 1 . Approximately 80% of MDS patients have anemia at the time of diagnosis 2 and around 60% of MDS patients will experience severe anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL) at some point during the course of their disease 3 . Lower-risk MDS patients represent approximately 77% of the total diagnosed MDS population 4 . Anemia in MDS patients is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular complications and the need for blood transfusion 5 . Transfusion dependent MDS patients suffer higher rates of cardiac events, infections and transformation to acute leukemia, and a decreased overall survival rate when compared with non-transfused patients with MDS, and decreased survival compared to an age-matched elderly population 6 . In addition, anemia frequently leads to significant fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased quality of life. Currently, there are few options available for treating anemia in MDS. Patients with MDS typically rely on repeated blood transfusions and administration of ESAs.

(NASDAQ: MGNX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, today announced the final overall survival (OS) results of the SOPHIA Phase 3 study in adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In 2020, MARGENZA (margetuximab-cmkb) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. The basis for this full approval was the progression-free survival (PFS) results in the SOPHIA study, which compared MARGENZA plus chemotherapy to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. The final OS analysis of the SOPHIA study was performed after 385 OS events occurred in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. As per the study protocol, OS was defined as the number of days from randomization to the date of death (from any cause). The final OS analysis for the ITT population did not demonstrate a statistically significant advantage for MARGENZA plus chemotherapy compared to that of patients who received trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR]=0.95; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.77-1.17; P=0.62). In this overall ITT population, the median survival was 21.6 months in patients treated with MARGENZA plus chemotherapy (N=266) compared to 21.9 months in patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (N=270). A pre-specified, non-alpha-allocated exploratory analysis evaluated the effect of CD16A allelic variation on MARGENZA activity. Among the patients in the trial carrying a CD16A 158F allele, representing approximately 82% of study patients (437 of 536 patients), the median OS was prolonged by 2.5 months in the MARGENZA arm compared to the trastuzumab arm (23.3 months versus 20.8 months; HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.69-1.08; nominal P=0.19). The numerical OS advantage was observed in the subgroup of CD16A patients who were homozygous for the F-allele at position 158 (i.e., “F/F” patients) in favor of MARGENZA plus chemotherapy (HR=0.72; 95% CI: 0.52-1.00; nominal P=0.05). In this subgroup, the median OS was 23.6 months in patients treated with MARGENZA plus chemotherapy (102 of 266 patients) compared to 19.2 months in patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (90 of 270 patients). In the subgroup of CD16A F/V patients, the median OS was 21.3 months in patients treated with MARGENZA plus chemotherapy (119 of 266 patients) compared to 22.0 months in patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (126 of 270 patients) (HR=0.96; 95% CI: 0.71-1.30; nominal P=0.78). In a small subgroup of CD16A V/V patients, OS was greater for trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than MARGENZA plus chemotherapy (HR=1.77; 95% CI: 1.01-3.12; nominal P=0.04). In this subgroup, the median survival was 22.0 months in patients treated with MARGENZA plus chemotherapy (37 of 266 patients) compared to 31.1 months in patients treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (32 of 270 patients). The safety profile at the time of the final OS analysis of SOPHIA was similar to what was previously reported and consistent with the product’s existing FDA-approved label. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20% of patients with MARGENZA in combination with chemotherapy were consistent with the existing product label. The MARGENZA U.S. Prescribing Information has a BOXED WARNING for left ventricular dysfunction and embryo-fetal toxicity. In addition, MARGENZA can cause infusion related reactions (IRRs). As stated in the U.S. Prescribing Information, IRRs occurred in 13% of patients treated with MARGENZA, with the majority reported as Grade 2 or less. Grade 3 IRRs occurred in 1.5% of patients. See below for Important Safety Information. “While the OS results in the SOPHIA ITT population are disappointing, the greater OS observed in the CD16A subgroup of patients with the lowest binding allelic variant of CD16 to the Fc region of IgG1 — namely, the F/F allele representing about 40% of all individuals (35.8% in this study) — is consistent with enhancements observed in MARGENZA’s engineered Fc region,” said Scott Koenig , M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of MacroGenics . “Therefore, further studies are warranted to determine the impact of MARGENZA on HER2-positive breast cancer patients with different CD16A allelic variants, including the ongoing investigator-sponsored neoadjuvant study examining the effects of MARGENZA versus trastuzumab in patients expressing F-allelic variants of CD16A. We continue to believe MARGENZA may be the right choice for certain patients,” added Dr. Koenig . The data will be submitted to the FDA and presented at a future scientific meeting. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION AND EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY Left Ventricular Dysfunction: MARGENZA may lead to reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Evaluate cardiac function prior to and during treatment. Discontinue MARGENZA treatment for a confirmed clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Exposure to MARGENZA during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of the risk and need for effective contraception. WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS: Left Ventricular Dysfunction Left ventricular cardiac dysfunction can occur with MARGENZA. In SOPHIA, left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with MARGENZA. MARGENZA has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of <50%, a prior history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months, or congestive heart failure NYHA class II-IV. Withhold MARGENZA for ≥16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values or LVEF below institutional limits of normal (or 50% if no limits available) and ≥10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Permanently discontinue MARGENZA if LVEF decline persists greater than 8 weeks, or dosing is interrupted more than 3 times due to LVEF decline. Evaluate cardiac function within 4 weeks prior to and every 3 months during and upon completion of treatment. Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. Monitor cardiac function every 4 weeks if MARGENZA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, MARGENZA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Post-marketing studies of other HER2 directed antibodies during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify pregnancy status of women of reproductive potential prior to initiation of MARGENZA. Advise pregnant women and women of reproductive potential that exposure to MARGENZA during pregnancy or within 4 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months following the last dose of MARGENZA . Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) MARGENZA can cause IRRs. Symptoms may include fever, chills, arthralgia, cough, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headache, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypotension, pruritus, rash, urticaria, and dyspnea. In SOPHIA, IRRs were reported by 13% of patients on MARGENZA plus chemotherapy. Most of the IRRs occur during Cycle 1. Grade 3 IRRs were reported in 1.5% of MARGENZA-treated patients. Monitor patients during and after MARGENZA infusion. Have medications and emergency equipment to treat IRRs available for immediate use. In patients experiencing mild or moderate IRRs, decrease rate of infusion and consider premedications, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and antipyretics. Monitor patients until symptoms completely resolve. Interrupt MARGENZA infusion in patients experiencing dyspnea or clinically significant hypotension and intervene with supportive medical therapy as needed. Permanently discontinue MARGENZA in all patients with severe or life-threatening IRRs. MOST COMMON ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse drug reactions (>10%) with MARGENZA in combination with chemotherapy are fatigue/asthenia (57%), nausea (33%), diarrhea (25%), vomiting (21%), constipation (19%), headache (19%), pyrexia (19%), alopecia (18%), abdominal pain (17%), peripheral neuropathy (16%), arthralgia/myalgia (14%), cough (14%), decreased appetite (14%), dyspnea (13%), infusion-related reactions (13%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (13%), and extremity pain (11%).

INDICATION MARGENZA is a HER2/neu receptor antagonist indicated, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. Please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning. About the SOPHIA Study The SOPHIA study (NCT02492711) is a randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating MARGENZA plus chemotherapy compared to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, who have previously been treated with anti-HER2-targeted therapies. All study patients had previously received trastuzumab, all but one patient had previously received pertuzumab, and 91% had previously received ado-trastuzumab emtansine, or T-DM1. The study enrolled 536 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive either MARGENZA (n=266) given intravenously at 15 mg/kg every three weeks or trastuzumab (n=270) given intravenously at 6 mg/kg (or 8 mg/kg for loading dose) every three weeks in combination with one of four chemotherapy agents (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine) given at the standard dose. Intent-to-treat PFS analysis occurred after 265 PFS events. The primary endpoints of the study were sequentially-assessed PFS, determined by blinded, centrally-reviewed radiological review, followed by OS. Additional key secondary endpoints are PFS by investigator assessment and ORR. Tertiary endpoints include ORR by investigator assessment and safety. PFS and ORR were assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). About HER2-positive Breast Cancer Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein found on the surface of some cancer cells that promotes growth and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Approximately 15-20% of breast cancer cases are HER2-positive. Monoclonal antibodies targeting HER2 have greatly improved outcomes; however, a significant number of patients progress to later lines of therapy. Effective treatments for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer continue to remain an unmet need. About MARGENZA MARGENZA (margetuximab-cmkb) is an Fc-engineered, monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 oncoprotein. HER2 is expressed by tumor cells in breast, gastroesophageal and other solid tumors. Similar to trastuzumab, margetuximab-cmkb inhibits tumor cell proliferation, reduces shedding of the HER2 extracellular domain and mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, through MacroGenics’ Fc Optimization technology, margetuximab-cmkb has been engineered to enhance the engagement of the immune system. In vitro, the modified Fc region of margetuximab-cmkb increases binding to the activating Fc receptor FCGR3A (CD16A) and decreases binding to inhibitor Fc receptor FCGR2B (CD32B).  These changes lead to greater in vitro ADCC and NK cell activation.  The clinical significance of in vitro data is unknown. MARGENZA is also being evaluated in combination with checkpoint blockade in the Phase 2/3 MAHOGANY trial for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive gastroesophageal cancer (NCT04082364), and in combination with tebotelimab (PD-1 × LAG-3 bispecific DART® molecule) in various HER2+ tumors (NCT03219268). In addition, MARGENZA is being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored, Phase 2 neoadjuvant study in patients with stage 2-3 HER2-positive breast cancer (NCT04425018).

The ADDRESS results show the proportion of PV patients achieving the primary endpoint of complete remission on a minimal dose of steroids (CRmin) was not significantly different between efgartigimod SC and placebo. argenx will not pursue additional development in pemphigus and plans to prioritize clinical development of efgartigimod in its ongoing severe autoimmune indications. “We are disappointed by today’s results, particularly for pemphigus patients who have seen little innovation in this treatment space,” said Luc Truyen, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at argenx. “At argenx, we are in the business of transformation, providing new medicines that go beyond incremental benefit and raise the bar for what patients can expect from a treatment. While we will not move forward into pemphigus, our job today is the same as yesterday – continue to be execution-focused and data-driven, apply learnings across our ongoing development programs, and pursue optimal development of efgartigimod, empasiprubart and our earlier stage programs. 2023 was a remarkable year of growth for argenx across the business and we are poised to build on our success in 2024. “We are grateful to the pemphigus community and all involved in the ADDRESS study, including patients, healthcare professionals, and our argenx teams,” continued Dr. Truyen. ADDRESS Study Results The Phase 3 ADDRESS study enrolled 222 adult patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing moderate-to-severe PV (n=190) or PF (n=32). Patients were randomized to efgartigimod SC or placebo with both treatment groups receiving concomitant steroids at a starting dose of 0.5mg/kg, which is a lower dose than recommended by current treatment guidelines and was tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission. Consistent pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of efgartigimod SC: Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and desmoglein autoantibody (DSG-1 and DSG-3) reductions up to 75%. The observed PD effect was consistent with previous clinical trials of efgartigimod. Unexpected PD effect of corticosteroids: There was a higher than expected response to background treatment with corticosteroids, which showed a reduction of DSG-1 and DSG-3 levels of up to 70% in the placebo arm and correlated to sustained clinical benefit. The level of autoantibody reduction driven by corticosteroids in both treatment arms was sufficient for patients to achieve CRmin. The significant PD effect of corticosteroids was specific to DSG-1 and DSG-3 autoantibodies, while the observed effect on total IgG reduction was in line with the literature (up to 10%). Study did not meet primary endpoint: Treatment with efgartigimod SC led to CRmin in 35.5% (44/124) of patients compared to 30.3% (20/66) with placebo (p=0.5956). Secondary endpoints were also not met, including CRmin in the overall pemphigus population (PV and PF), cumulative dose of corticosteroids and time to disease control or complete remission Consistent and favorable safety profile: Efgartigimod SC was well-tolerated in ADDRESS. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials and the confirmed safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo. Update on BALLAD Study argenx is reviewing the BALLAD study in light of the ADDRESS results and the comparable biology between pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid, and has decided not to make a GO/NO GO decision at this time but rather wait for learnings from all currently enrolled patients and consider a new trial design for the path forward. Conference Call Details argenx will host a conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADDRESS results. A webcast of the live call and replay may be accessed on the Investors section of the argenx website. Dial-in Numbers: Please dial in 15 minutes prior to the live call.

Enrolled patients had newly diagnosed or relapsing moderate-to-severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF) with PDAI scores of ≥15. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod SC or placebo for a total of 30 weeks as part of the primary trial. All patients were on concomitant corticosteroids at a starting dose of 0.5mg/kg/day, which could be tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission (PDAI = 0). The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of PV patients who achieved sustained complete remission on a minimal dose of corticosteroids (CRmin) within 30 weeks. Key secondary endpoints included proportion of overall population (PV and PF) who achieved CRmin, cumulative corticosteroid dose, and time to disease control and complete remission. At the end of the 30-week study, eligible patients entered a double-blind 8-week follow-up as part of the ADDRESS open-label extension study during which CRmin off treatment (efgartigimod SC or placebo) was assessed. About Pemphigus Pemphigus is a rare group of chronic blistering autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes, and are characterized by painful blisters, erosions and acantholysis, or disruption of keratinocyte adhesion. Blisters often break open, causing serious pain and increased risk of infection. Pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous are the most common forms of pemphigus. About the BALLAD Study The BALLAD study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in adult patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP). Enrolled patients have moderate to severe BP and are a more fragile and older population than pemphigus patients. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for a total of 36 weeks as part of the primary trial. All patients are on concomitant corticosteroids at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day, which could be tapered according to protocol upon achievement of complete remission (BPDAI= 0). The primary endpoint is measured at 36 weeks by the proportion of BP patients who achieved clinical remission while receiving efgartigimod SC or placebo but off corticosteroids therapy for at least 8 weeks. Key secondary endpoints include cumulative dose of corticosteroids from baseline, proportion of patients who achieve an Investigator Global Assessment of BP (IGA-BP) score of 0 or 1, changes from baseline in the BP Disease Area Index (BPDAI) activity score, proportion of patients who are in CR on minimal corticosteroids for at least 8 weeks at week 36 and time to control of disease or complete remission. About Bullous Pemphigus Bullous pemphigoid  is a rare chronic blistering autoimmune disease and is the most common form of pemphigoid diseases. It is characterized by autoantibodies against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction and, clinically, by tense blisters and erosions of skin or mucous membranes close to the skin surface. The disease has a strong impact on a person’s quality of life and is associated with a high mortality. About VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod SC) VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa, a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®, and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics.

(Nasdaq:KPTI), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, today announced the results of a planned interim analysis of the Phase 2 SOPRA study evaluating single agent selinexor in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  The Company determined in concert with the study's independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that SOPRA will not reach statistical significance for overall survival (OS), the study's primary endpoint.  However, since selinexor-treated patients that achieved a complete response (CR) showed a substantial OS benefit as compared with the physician's choice (PC) arm, Karyopharm and the DSMB agreed that patients would be permitted to continue on the selinexor arm or the PC arm, as applicable, following discussion between the patient and their treating physician. The Company plans to continue clinical development of selinexor in AML through investigator sponsored trials in multiple combination regimens, including with chemotherapy, given encouraging data to date across these settings. SOPRA is a Phase 2 randomized study of patients 60 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or transplantation.  Patients were randomized to either receive single-agent oral selinexor 60mg twice weekly or PC. PC included best supportive care (BSC) alone, or BSC plus either azacitidine (Vidaza®), decitabine (Dacogen®), or low dose cytosine arabinoside (LD-AraC). Based on unaudited site data, SOPRA enrolled 176 patients (median of two prior regimens) in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Israel.  Among patients on the selinexor arm, 13% demonstrated a CR with or without full hematologic recovery (CRi) compared to 3% of patients on the PC control arm. Some patients remained on selinexor for over one year, but this did not result in a statistically superior OS compared to the PC arm.  The DSMB found no new clinically significant adverse events in the patients receiving selinexor.  Importantly, rates of sepsis and febrile neutropenia (FN) were lower on the selinexor arm (sepsis 4.9%, FN 14.7%) compared to the PC arm (sepsis 6.1%, FN 36.4%).  As expected, the most common selinexor-related adverse events were nausea, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. Patients who have benefited from selinexor treatment on the SOPRA study have the option to continue therapy. ""SOPRA is a robust, well-conducted trial and the response rates achieved with single-agent selinexor in this heavily pretreated older population have been encouraging,"" said Hagop Kantarjian, MD, Chair of the Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.  ""Importantly, the safety profile was as expected and the recommended Phase 2 dose was generally well-tolerated.  Unfortunately, as is common in AML, the higher response rates observed with single-agent selinexor versus physician's choice did not translate into extended survival in the overall population of these frail and heavily pretreated patients."" ""After performing an in-depth analysis, we and the DSMB agree that, despite the higher complete response rates observed with selinexor, the phase 2 SOPRA study evaluating single-agent selinexor in relapsed or refractory AML has not reached statistical significance for overall survival, the primary endpoint of the study,"" said Michael G. Kauffman, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Karyopharm.  ""While we are disappointed with the overall outcome, we are pleased that 60mg of single-agent selinexor dosed twice per week was well-tolerated and carried no increased risk of sepsis or febrile neutropenia.  At Karyopharm, our primary focus remains the advancement of selinexor in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, where we believe we have a clear path to regulatory approval."" Dr. Kauffman continued, ""Beyond myeloma, we see diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and liposarcoma as high unmet need indications where selinexor has a meaningful opportunity for clinical success and where we are expecting key data readouts during 2017.  We look forward to reporting top-line data from our randomized Phase 2b SADAL study evaluating single-agent selinexor in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL in early 2017 and top-line data from the Phase 2 portion of the randomized Phase 2/3 SEAL study evaluating single-agent selinexor in patients with advanced liposarcoma in mid-2017."" Sharon Shacham, PhD, MBA, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Karyopharm, commented, ""We continue to believe selinexor has potential in AML, most likely in combination with other agents in front line and later settings. We continue to explore the use of selinexor in combination with novel and standard agents through investigator-sponsored AML studies. Clinical data recently reported at the 2016 American Society of Hematology annual meeting demonstrated that selinexor in combination with certain standard therapies, including intensive chemotherapy as well as hypomethylating agents, demonstrated encouraging activity in AML in adults, both as an initial therapy and in the relapsed setting. The benefit of selinexor in combination with intensive chemotherapy will be assessed in randomized investigator sponsored trials that we expect will begin in 2017. Furthermore, selinexor in combination with intensive chemotherapy has shown very promising responses in pediatric patients with heavily pretreated AML."" ""We are deeply grateful for the support and commitment of the AML investigators and the patients and families who have taken part in or contributed to the SOPRA study,"" Dr. Shacham concluded. More About the Phase 2 SOPRA Study The Phase 2 SOPRA ( S elinexor in O lder P atients with R elapsed/Refractory A ML) study is a randomized trial evaluating single-agent selinexor (KPT-330), Karyopharm's lead, novel, oral Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE™ compound, versus physician's choice in patients 60 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML who were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or transplantation.  In the SOPRA study, 176 patients with AML whose disease had relapsed after, or was refractory to, first line therapy were randomized 2:1 to receive either oral selinexor (60 mg twice per week) or one of four physician's choice (PC) therapies.  Physician's choice included best supportive care (BSC) alone, or BSC plus either azacytidine (Vidaza®), decitabine (Dacogen®), or low dose cytosine arabinoside (LD-AraC).  The primary endpoint of the SOPRA study was overall survival (OS), with a target of a 75% improvement in OS from 3.0 months in the PC arm to 5.2 months in the selinexor arm.  SOPRA was conducted at approximately 94 sites worldwide, including sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Israel. About Selinexor Selinexor (KPT-330) is a first-in-class, oral Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE™ compound. Selinexor functions by binding with and inhibiting the nuclear export protein XPO1 (also called CRM1), leading to the accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins in the cell nucleus. This reinitiates and amplifies their tumor suppressor function and is believed to lead to the selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, while largely sparing normal cells. To date, over 1,900 patients have been treated with selinexor and it is currently being evaluated in several mid- and later-phase clinical trials across multiple cancer indications, including in multiple myeloma in combination with low-dose dexamethasone (STORM) and backbone therapies (STOMP), and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SADAL), and liposarcoma (SEAL), among others. Karyopharm plans to initiate a pivotal randomized Phase 3 study of selinexor in combination with bortezomib (Velcade®) and low-dose dexamethasone (BOSTON) in patients with multiple myeloma in early 2017. Additional Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies are ongoing or currently planned, including multiple studies in combination with one or more approved therapies in a variety of tumor types to further inform the Company's clinical development priorities for selinexor. The latest clinical trial information for selinexor is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov . About Karyopharm Therapeutics Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:KPTI) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel first-in-class drugs directed against nuclear transport and related targets for the treatment of cancer and other major diseases.

Seres Therapeutics Announces Interim Results from SER-109 Phase 2 ECOSPOR Study in Multiply Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection Jul 29, 2016 at 7:00 AM EDT PDF Version - Primary efficacy endpoint was not achieved - - Conference call at 8:30 AM ET today - CAMBRIDGE, Mass. --(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 29, 2016-- Seres Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MCRB), a leading microbiome
      therapeutics company, today announced interim 8-week results from the
      ongoing SER-109 Phase 2 ECOSPOR TM clinical study for the
      prevention of multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infection
      (CDI). The study’s primary endpoint of reducing the relative risk of CDI
      recurrence at up to 8-weeks was not achieved. Seres continues to gather
      and analyze study data, and in consultation with the FDA , plans to make
      appropriate adjustments to its SER-109 development plans. Study Design and Results Study Design : The Phase 2 study enrolled
        89 subjects with multiply recurrent CDI, defined as 3 or more recent
        recurrences, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week
        study conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-109.
        Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio with 59 subjects receiving
        SER-109 and 30 subjects receiving placebo. SER-109 was administered
        orally as a single dose, of 1 X 10 8 bacterial spores,
        following the completion of antibiotic treatment for CDI. The study
        was conducted at 36 centers across the United States . Reported interim
        results reflect the available eight-week study data, including the
        primary efficacy endpoint, for the intent-to-treat study population. Summary of Efficacy : The predefined study
        primary efficacy endpoint is the relative risk of CDI recurrence up to
        8 weeks after treatment comparing subjects in the placebo arm with the
        SER-109 arm. CDI recurrence is defined as diarrhea for 2 or more
        consecutive days, a positive CDI test, and the requirement for
        antibiotic treatment. Based on 8-week data, CDI recurrence occurred in
        44% of subjects (26 of 59) who received SER-109, compared to 53% of
        subjects (16 of 30) who received placebo. The relative risk of CDI
        recurrence for the placebo population compared to the SER-109
        population was not statistically significant. As part of the
        prespecified design, subjects were stratified into two groups: <65
        years old and ≥65 years old. In subjects <65 years old, CDI recurrence
        occurred in 43% of subjects who received SER-109 (12 of 28) and in 27%
        of subjects who received placebo (4 of 15). In subjects ≥65 years old,
        CDI recurrence occurred in 45% of subjects who received SER-109 (14 of
        31), and in 80% of those who received placebo (12 of 15). Summary of Safety : Based on the
        eight-week data, we did not observe any difference in the adverse
        event frequency or type in the subjects receiving SER-109 compared to
        those receiving placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in
        both the SER-109 and placebo arms were in the gastrointestinal
        category. The most common adverse events reported in the SER-109 arm
        were diarrhea, abdominal pain and flatulence. No drug-related serious
        adverse events were observed. Roger Pomerantz , MD, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of
      Seres commented: “These are unexpected clinical results in view of the
      positive data in our prior investigator-sponsored Phase 1b trial, as
      well as in a wide range of supporting clinical and preclinical data.
      Specifically, the recurrence rates observed in the overall SER-109
      treatment group, in the age stratified subgroups, and in the placebo
      groups are inconsistent with our expectations. Our priority is to
      complete a full review of the clinical results and microbiome data of
      the Phase 2 study and to compare it to data from the prior investigator
      sponsored Phase 1b. Based on this information and pending discussions
      with the FDA , we plan to make any necessary changes to our development
      plans for SER-109.” Dr. Pomerantz continued: “ C. difficile infection treatment
      options, including unregulated fecal microbial transplants, remain poor.
      The confounding placebo data obtained in this study further highlight
      the significant need for new, effective, FDA regulated therapeutic
      options for these patients. We will take our learnings from this study
      and continue in our pioneering efforts to develop meaningful new
      microbiome therapeutics for C. difficile infection and other
      serious diseases.” Conference Call Information Seres management will host a conference call today, July 29, 2016 , at 8:30 AM ET . A webcast of the conference call may be accessed in the

ROCCELLA is a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of three different once-daily oral doses of GLPG1972/S201086 in 932 patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) over 52 weeks of treatment. The study population was aged between 40 to 76 years (mean age was 63), mainly female (70%), and with a mean disease duration of 7 years. The primary objective of ROCCELLA was to demonstrate the efficacy of at least one dose of GLPG1972/S201086 compared to placebo after 52 weeks of treatment in reducing cartilage loss of the central medial tibiofemoral compartment of the target knee via quantitative MRI. The trial failed to meet the primary objective. The change from baseline to week 52 in cartilage thickness, in mm (SD) was -0.116 (0.27) for the placebo group and -0.068 (0.20), -0.097 (0.27) and -0.085 (0.22), for the low, medium and high dose, respectively. Statistically significant difference versus placebo was not reached in any of the treated groups. There was no significant difference compared to placebo observed on secondary endpoints, including clinical outcomes. Additional analyses are being conducted to fully evaluate the results, which will be presented at upcoming medical conferences. GLPG1972/S201086 was generally well-tolerated by patients in this Phase 2 trial. “ While we are disappointed that ADAMTS-5 inhibition by GLPG1972/S201086 proved not to make a difference in this trial, we want to express our gratitude to all participating patients and investigators. This study result, while not what we hoped for, does add to the body of knowledge to help fight OA, a disease with substantial unmet medical need, ” said Dr. Walid Abi-Saab, Chief Medical Officer of Galapagos. “ We are pleased to have performed this study with Galapagos. Unfortunately, the ROCCELLA results provided insufficient evidence of GLPG1972/S201086 efficacy in patients with knee osteoarthritis. We acknowledge the importance of assessing this innovative mechanism of action in the clinical setting and we will continue analyzing the data for better knowledge of the disease for the benefit of the patients and for future developments. We would like also to thank all patients and investigators for participating in this very important study,” said Dr. Patricia Belissa-Mathiot, Director of Clinical Development and R&D Chief Medical Officer at Servier.

Seres Therapeutics Announces Topline Results for SER-287 Phase 2b Study in Mild-to-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis Jul 22, 2021 at 7:00 AM EDT PDF Version —Primary endpoint of clinical remission compared to placebo was not achieved— —Both dosing regimens of SER-287 were generally well tolerated— —Open label and maintenance portions of the SER-287 study will be closed— — Microbiome endpoints and analyses expected in the second half of 2021— —Company to host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET— CAMBRIDGE, Mass. --(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 22, 2021-- Seres Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCRB), a leading microbiome therapeutics company, today announced topline results from the Phase 2b ECO-RESET study evaluating SER-287 in patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improving clinical remission rates compared to placebo. Both dosing regimens of SER-287 were generally well tolerated. Given the lack of a clinical efficacy signal identified in ECO-RESET, the Company has decided to close the open label and maintenance portions of the study. “While these outcomes were not what we, nor the UC community, were hoping for, we remain committed to leading the creation of a new class of medicines designed to impact how diseases like ulcerative colitis are treated. As with SER-109, we will again follow the science and the data, conduct a rigorous scientific analysis, and determine the optimal path forward for our UC franchise,” said Eric Shaff , Chief Executive Officer at Seres. “We are well resourced and continue to prepare for SER-109 commercialization, in collaboration with Nestlé Health Science, and we are excited about advancing the development of our SER-301 and SER-155 investigational candidates as well as our earlier stage pipeline.” The primary objective of the induction portion of the Phase 2b study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SER-287, after 10 weeks of induction dosing (following vancomycin pre-conditioning) in achieving clinical remission in participants with mild-to-moderate UC. The trial was a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, parallel group multicenter study which enrolled 203 UC patients in 104 sites throughout the U.S. and Canada . Dosing was explored in two SER-287 cohorts (full induction dose and step-down induction dose) or placebo (randomized 1:1:1). Clinical remission was analyzed and defined by a 3-component modified Mayo Score . No meaningful clinical differences and no statistical significance were observed in absolute clinical remission rates among the three treatment arms (10.3% for the full induction dose, n=68 and 10.6% for the step-down induction dose, n=66 versus 11.6% for placebo, n=69). There were also no meaningful differences observed across the three treatment groups for endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission or symptomatic remission. “While the efficacy results in this trial did not meet the pre-defined threshold, we believe this data-rich study, including microbiome analyses expected in the second half of 2021, will provide valuable insights to inform continued development of our pipeline, including SER-301, our next generation investigational candidate for UC,” said Lisa von Moltke , M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Seres. “We are grateful for everyone who made this study possible, including the study investigators, and in particular, the patients and their families."" Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were observed in 67.6%, 46.2% and 50.7% of subjects in the induction dose, step-down dose (both of which included six days of oral vancomycin preconditioning) and placebo treatment arms, respectively. The majority of observed AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The most commonly observed AEs were worsening of UC, diarrhea, nausea and abdominal distension. Four participants on active treatment reported serious treatment emergent adverse events (worsening ulcerative colitis, colonic dysplasia, congestive heart failure with decreased hemoglobin, and appendicitis), as did one on placebo (worsening ulcerative colitis). The Company continues to advance its SER-301 program currently in a Phase 1b study that is testing the hypothesis that engraftment of drug product species modulates microbe-associated metabolites to reduce intestinal inflammation and improve epithelial barrier integrity in adults with mild-to-moderate UC. The Phase 1b is currently enrolling in Australia and New Zealand . SER-287 and SER-301 are both consortia of bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals. However, important compositional and potential therapeutic differences exist between the investigational drugs. SER-287 is a donor-derived product candidate, whereas SER-301 utilizes Seres’ next generation technology and is based on rationally designed, cultivated consortia of bacteria. The design of SER-301 has leveraged the Company’s reverse translation platforms and capabilities that can evaluate at high resolution how microbes in the gastrointestinal tract are interacting with one another and human cells and tissues to impact disease pathways. The bacteria in SER-301 are targeted at, and specifically selected in, an effort to optimize the reduction of pro-inflammatory activity, improve epithelial barrier integrity and TNF-a driven inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells, and modulate UC-relevant anti-inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune pathways. Results from the SER-287 ECO-RESET study, including additional efficacy and safety results as well as microbiome analyses, will be submitted for presentation at a future scientific meeting. As of June 30, 2021 , Seres had approximately $229 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The June 30, 2021 cash balance does not include the upfront fee of $175 million that has been received by Seres following the SER-109 Co-Commercialization License Agreement announced on July 1, 2021 with Nestlé Health Science. About SER-301 SER-301 is a consortium of cultivated bacteria designed using our reverse translational discovery platform that incorporates analysis of microbiome biomarkers from human clinical data and preclinical assessments using human cell-based assays and in vitro/ex vivo and in vivo disease models. SER-301 is designed to reduce induction of pro-inflammatory activity, improve epithelial barrier integrity and TNF-α driven inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells, or IECs, and modulate UC-relevant anti-inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune pathways. SER-301 is being produced using our advanced fermentation, formulation and delivery platforms. It includes strains delivered in spore form, as well as strains cultivated in non-spore (vegetative) form and delivered using enterically-protected technology designed to release in the colon. About Seres Therapeutics Seres Therapeutics, Inc. , (Nasdaq: MCRB) is a leading microbiome therapeutics company developing a novel class of multifunctional bacterial consortia that are designed to functionally interact with host cells and tissues to treat disease. Seres’ SER-109 program achieved the first-ever positive pivotal clinical results for a targeted microbiome drug candidate and has obtained Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA. The SER-109 program is being advanced for the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection and has potential to become a first-in-class FDA-approved microbiome therapeutic. Seres is evaluating SER-301 in a Phase 1b study in patients with ulcerative colitis and SER-155 in a Phase 1b study to address gastrointestinal infections, bacteremia and graft-versus-host disease.

      placebo comparator group at three time points 7 days following insertion
      of the depots, was not achieved. While mean ocular itching was seen to
      be numerically lower (more favorable) in the DEXTENZA treatment group
      compared to the placebo group measured 7 days following insertion of the
      depots, at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -0.18, -0.29, and -0.29 units,
      respectively, on a five point scale, this difference did not reach
      statistical significance. In addition, the trial did not achieve the
      requirement of at least a 0.5 unit difference at all three time points 7
      days following insertion of the depots and at least a 1.0 unit
      difference at the majority of the three time points between the
      treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the
      depots. The trial also assessed conjunctival redness as a secondary endpoint.
      The differences in the mean scores in conjunctival redness between the
      DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following
      insertion of the depots at 7, 15 and 20 minutes were -0.35, -0.39 and
      -0.42, respectively, compared with values of -0.26, -0.32 and -0.41,
      respectively, at the same time points 7 days following insertion of the
      depots in the first Phase 3 trial. The results from the second Phase 3 trial contrast with those achieved
      in the first Phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA for the treatment of
      allergic conjunctivitis announced in October 2015 , in which the primary
      endpoint of treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic
      conjunctivitis was successfully achieved, with mean ocular itching
      scores being lower in the DEXTENZA group at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by
      -1.02, -0.87, and -1.04 units, respectively (p<0.0001), 7 days following
      insertion of the depots. In the second Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as other DEXTENZA clinical
      trials completed to date regardless of indication, DEXTENZA has
      exhibited a strong safety profile and has been generally well-tolerated.
      There were no serious adverse events observed in the second Phase 3
      clinical trial. “We are disappointed that the primary endpoint of ocular itching
      associated with allergic conjunctivitis was not achieved in our second
      Phase 3 trial in these patients, and this result is inconsistent with
      what we saw in our first Phase 3 trial,” said Amar Sawhney , Ph.D.,
      President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. “We are currently in
      the process of conducting a thorough analysis of the data from the
      second Phase 3 trial to fully understand the difference in efficacy
      between the two Phase 3 trials. There was a greater variability in
      ocular itching exhibited by patients in the second Phase 3 trial over
      the multiple allergen challenges 7, 14 and 28 days following insertion
      of the depots, compared to the first Phase 3 trial. In a post hoc
      analysis, when ocular itching scores were averaged over these multiple
      visits, a statistically significant reduction of symptoms over the
      entire 1 month intended duration of sustained release, single dose
      therapy was observed in the DEXTENZA treatment group relative to the
      placebo vehicle group. Since this analysis was not part of the original
      end points, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss the results and
      chart an appropriate path forward for the development of DEXTENZA for
      the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.” Dr. Sawhney continued, “We remain confident in the potential of our
      innovative sustained release platform to address diverse applications in
      ophthalmology. We look forward to the July 2016 PDUFA date for DEXTENZA
      for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain.” Second Phase 3 Study Design This Phase 3 prospective, U.S.-based multicenter, 1:1 randomized,
      double-masked, vehicle-controlled trial in 86 patients was designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA™ (sustained release
      dexamethasone), Intracanalicular Depot for the treatment of signs and
      symptoms of chronic allergic conjunctivitis. This was the second Phase 3
      trial which evaluated DEXTENZA versus a placebo vehicle punctum plug
      using Ophthalmic Research Associate’s modified Conjunctival Allergen
      Challenge (Ora-CAC ® ) Model ( Ora, Inc. , Andover, MA ), which
      accommodates for the longer therapeutic effect of a seasonal one-time
      administered drug product. The trial was designed to assess the effect of DEXTENZA compared with
      placebo on allergic reactions. DEXTENZA or placebo was administered 48
      to 72 hours after the first set of allergen challenges confirming the
      appropriate allergen and dose exposure to incite an allergic response,
      followed by three series of successive allergen challenges over a 30 day
      period. The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated was the difference in
      mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the
      placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of
      the depots. The trial also included a secondary efficacy endpoint for
      conjunctival redness which evaluated the difference in mean scores in
      conjunctival redness between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle
      group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots. Ocular Therapeutix reported topline results of its first Phase 3
      allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial with DEXTENZA in October 2015 ,
      where the primary endpoint for ocular itching associated with allergic
      conjunctivitis was successfully achieved and the primary endpoint for
      conjunctival redness was not achieved. About Allergic Conjunctivitis Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva
      resulting primarily from a reaction to allergy-causing substances such
      as pollen or pet dander. The primary symptom of this inflammation is
      acute ocular itching and the primary sign is conjunctival redness.
      Allergic conjunctivitis ranges in clinical severity from relatively
      mild, common forms to more severe forms that can cause impaired vision.
      According to a study on the management of seasonal allergic
      conjunctivitis published in 2012 in the peer-reviewed journal Acta Ophthalmologica, allergic conjunctivitis affects 15% to 40% of the U.S.
      population. For patients with chronic or more severe forms of allergic
      conjunctivitis, antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are often not
      sufficient to treat their signs and symptoms. Many ocular allergy
      sufferers are not responsive to the conventional dual-acting
      antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers. These refractory patients are
      frequently treated with topical corticosteroids administered by eye
      drops. About the Modified Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (Ora-CAC ® )
      Model The modified Ora-CAC ® model used in the recently completed
      clinical trial has been developed to study the interactions between the
      early and late phases of the allergic response in the eye, and to
      evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical intervention. The modified Ora-CAC ® model utilizes four challenges conducted over a 2-day interval to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a test agent to prevent an acute ocular
      allergic reaction, as well as evaluate the test agent’s ability to
      prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction in the presence of subclinical
      late phase inflammation. Conference Call & Webcast Information Members of the Ocular Therapeutix management team will host a live

(NASDAQ: MGNX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, as well as autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases, today announced the presentation of updated data from its Phase 1 study of MGD010 at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in Madrid, Spain. In a poster titled ""Immunomodulatory Effects of MGD010, a DART® Molecule Targeting Human B-cell CD32B and CD79B,"" the Company highlighted the immunomodulatory impact of MGD010 on the response to hepatitis A vaccination (HAV), a model antigen challenge, in normal healthy subjects. These data demonstrate that by pharmacologically exploiting the activity of the checkpoint molecule CD32B in combination with the B-cell receptor (BCR) CD79B component, a single dose administration of MGD010 at either 3 or 10 mg/kg delivers an immunomodulatory effect that counters B-cell function. In this portion of the Phase 1 study, 23 evaluable healthy subjects received 3 or 10 mg/kg MGD010 or placebo, followed by HAV immunization. There were no CTCAE grade 3 or higher adverse events related to MGD010. Consistent with prior observations, ex vivo flow cytometric analysis confirmed dose-dependent MGD010 binding to peripheral B cells without B-cell depletion, accompanied by decreased surface BCR and CD40 expression as well as a decrease in total serum IgM levels. Compared to the placebo group, reduced HAV seroconversion rates were observed in subjects treated with MGD010, with significantly lower HA-specific IgG levels. ""The updated data regarding HAV seroconversion further confirm that MGD010 can exert immunomodulatory activity in vivo consistent with its intended mechanism of action. Combined with its good safety profile, these results provide compelling rationale for further development of this therapeutic modality for autoimmune disorders,"" said Scott Koenig, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of MacroGenics. The poster is available for download from the Events & Presentations page on MacroGenics' website at http://ir.macrogenics.com/events.cfm . About MGD010 MGD010 is a humanized DART molecule that simultaneously targets CD32B and CD79B. This product candidate is the first clinical autoimmune-focused DART program. In normal conditions, B cells utilize the checkpoint receptor, CD32B, as one of the key negative regulators to ensure that tolerance to self is maintained and autoimmune disorders do not occur. MGD010 exploits this mechanism and triggers this immune checkpoint loop for the inhibition of B-cell function, an approach that may be useful for the treatment of patients with autoimmune disorders. MacroGenics reported initial data from a Phase 1 study of MGD010 at EULAR 2016. The initial portion of this study was a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which a single dose of MGD010 was intravenously (IV) administered to 49 healthy subjects. Data from the study showed that the molecule was well tolerated at all dose levels and no serious adverse effects were reported. None of the subjects participating in the study had premature discontinuations or infusion reactions, systemic hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions. The data from this study demonstrated that MGD010 was well tolerated as a single dose up to 10 mg/kg, with no evidence of peripheral B-cell activation or depletion. Moreover, MGD010 exhibited: (1) linear pharmacokinetics with properties similar to those of an antibody molecule, (2) dose-dependent B-cell occupancy (with saturation >1 mg/kg), (3) down-modulation of BCR expression among circulating memory and naïve B cells, (4) downregulation of BCR-induced signaling and diminished propensity for ex-vivo BCR-induced B-cell activation, (5) a decrease in expression of the costimulatory CD40 molecule, and (6) a decrease in circulating immunoglobulin M levels.

(NASDAQ: FGEN) today announced topline results from its Phase 3 ZEPHYRUS-1 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of pamrevlumab in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The study compared treatment with pamrevlumab to placebo and did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC) at week 48 (p=0.29). The mean decline in FVC from baseline to week 48 was 260 ml in the pamrevlumab arm compared to 330 ml in the placebo arm (placebo-corrected difference of 70 ml; 95% CI -60 to 190 ml). The secondary endpoint of time to disease progression (FVC percent predicted decline of ≥10% or death) was also not met (HR= 0.78; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15). In the safety analysis, pamrevlumab was generally safe and well tolerated and the majority of treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were observed in 28.2% of patients in the pamrevlumab group and 34.3% of patients in the placebo group. Based on the results of ZEPHYRUS-1, ZEPHYRUS-2, the second Phase 3 clinical trial, will be discontinued. FibroGen plans to communicate the results of the ZEPHYRUS-1 study at an upcoming medical forum. “We are deeply disappointed that these results do not support pamrevlumab as a new treatment for IPF,” said Mark D. Eisner , MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer, FibroGen . “FibroGen would like to thank the patients and clinical trial investigators for their dedication to participating in this study.” FibroGen anticipates reporting topline data from Phase 3 studies with pamrevlumab for the treatment of ambulatory DMD patients (LELANTOS-2) in 3Q 2023, locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPIS) in 1H 2024, and metastatic pancreatic cancer (Precision Promise). “FibroGen’s focus will be on reporting the additional pamrevlumab studies, advancing our pipeline, and continuing commercialization of roxadustat in China and in countries where approved,” said Enrique Conterno , Chief Executive Officer, FibroGen .

About ZEPHYRUS A total of 356 patients with IPF were enrolled into ZEPHYRUS-1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in patients with IPF. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either pamrevlumab or placebo for 48 weeks. The Phase 3 clinical development program evaluating pamrevlumab for the treatment of IPF consists of two studies, ZEPHYRUS-1 and ZEPHYRUS-2. These trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in patients with IPF. For more information about ZEPHYRUS-1 and ZEPHYRUS-2, please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03955146 and NCT04419558 ). About Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function in which lung tissue becomes damaged, stiff, and scarred. As tissue scarring progresses, transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream is increasingly impaired, leading to irreversible loss of lung function, as well as high morbidity and mortality. About Pamrevlumab Pamrevlumab is a potential first-in-class antibody being developed by FibroGen to inhibit the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders characterized by persistent and excessive scarring that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Pamrevlumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC), and ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and in Phase 2/3 for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug Designation, and Fast Track designation to pamrevlumab for the treatment of patients with DMD, and LAPC. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to pamrevlumab for the treatment of patients with DMD. Pamrevlumab has demonstrated a safety and tolerability profile that has supported ongoing clinical investigation in IPF, DMD, and LAPC. Pamrevlumab is an investigational drug and not approved for marketing by any regulatory authority. For information about our pamrevlumab studies please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov .

(NASDAQ:CLDX) today reported that the Company's randomized, Phase 2b METRIC Study of glembatumumab vedotin compared to Xeloda ® (capecitabine) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that overexpress gpNMB failed to meet its primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an independent, central reading of patient scans (Hazard ratio = 0.95; median PFS: glembatumumab vedotin 2.9 months vs. Xeloda 2.8 months; p=0.76). There was no significant advantage for glembatumumab vedotin in key secondary endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival. The glembatumumab vedotin safety profile was consistent with prior experience. ""Triple-negative breast cancer is a very difficult disease to treat, and we are extremely disappointed for patients that the METRIC Study was not successful,"" said Anthony Marucci, Co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Celldex Therapeutics. ""On behalf of Celldex, I want to express our gratitude to the METRIC investigators, patients and families who participated in this study. Based on these results, we have also made the decision to discontinue the glembatumumab vedotin program across all indications and are currently prioritizing our pipeline, which includes five candidates in ongoing clinical studies. In line with this, we are evaluating our operational and workforce needs to extend our financial resources and direct them to continued pipeline advancement. Once we solidify these plans, we intend to update investors."" Celldex's clinical-stage pipeline includes the following compounds: Varlilumab, a CD27 agonist, currently completing a Phase 2 study in combination with Opdivo ® in multiple indications with data expected to be presented at multiple medical meetings in 2018; CDX-3379, an ErbB3 inhibitor, which is expected to complete enrollment in the first stage of a Phase 2 study in combination with Erbitux ® in head and neck cancer during the third quarter of 2018; CDX-014, a TIM-1 targeted agent, which is actively enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study in renal cell and ovarian clear cell carcinomas; CDX-1140, a CD40 agonist, which is actively enrolling patients in a Phase 1 study in various solid tumors; and, CDX-301, a dendritic cell mobilizer, currently being studied in an investigator-sponsored study in combination with radiation therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Data from this study were presented in a plenary session at the AACR Annual Meeting on Sunday, April 15, 2018. Celldex believes its pipeline prioritization and organizational restructuring efforts will extend financial resources beyond the guidance issued in the Company's year-end 2017 earnings press release and associated filings. The Company plans to provide revised guidance in its first quarter 2018 financial results in early May.

About METRIC The METRIC study is a randomized Phase 2b study of glembatumumab vedotin in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancers that overexpress gpNMB. In this indication, overexpression is defined as greater than or equal to 25% of tumor cells testing positive for gpNMB. Patients were randomized 2 to 1 to either glembatumumab vedotin or to capecitabine, also known by the tradename Xeloda ® , as a comparator. In total, 327 patients were enrolled into METRIC. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), which is defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease progression, assessed based on an independent, central reading of patient scans, or death due to any cause. The study called for 203 progression events for evaluation of the primary endpoint. The sum of the data, including the secondary endpoints of response rate, overall survival, duration of response and safety, are also important in assessing clinical benefit. About Glembatumumab Vedotin Glembatumumab vedotin is a fully human monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets glycoprotein NMB (gpNMB). gpNMB is a protein overexpressed by multiple tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, uveal melanoma and osteosarcoma. The gpNMB-targeting antibody, CR011, is linked to a potent cytotoxic, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), using Seattle Genetics' proprietary technology. Glembatumumab vedotin is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into gpNMB-expressing tumor cells, resulting in a targeted cell-killing effect.

Ultragenyx plans to discontinue the Glut1 DS development program, and will work with investigators and patients on a reasonable transition plan for patients with Glut1 DS who are still on UX007. Ultragenyx has a separate program evaluating UX007 in long-chain fatty oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD), which continues on track. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has accepted the Company’s proposal to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for UX007 for the treatment of LC-FAOD based on existing data, and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA will take place before the end of 2018. In the EU, Ultragenyx will discuss these data with the European Medicines Agency and expects to have an update this year. “We had previously observed significant improvements in individual cases of Glut1 DS with UX007 and so we are particularly disappointed by the results of the Glut1 DS study in a larger group of patients that did not demonstrate this same effect. We are grateful for the commitment and dedication of patients, caregivers, and investigators as well as our employees to this program,” said Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. “We continue to move forward with our UX007 program in long-chain fatty acid disorders which is not affected by this Glut1 DS outcome. We look forward to providing an update on UX007 regulatory discussions later this year.” The Phase 3 UX007 Glut1 DS study enrolled 44 children and adults experiencing disabling paroxysmal movement disorders associated with Glut1 DS. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment sequences. Patients in the first group had a two-week titration period followed by an eight-week treatment period on UX007. They then began a two-week washout period, followed by a two-week titration period and an eight-week period on placebo. Patients in the second group followed the same schedule but started with placebo and then crossed over to UX007. Following the 22-week blinded crossover study period, patients could roll into the open-label extension period to continue on UX007 treatment. The primary endpoint was the difference in frequency of disabling paroxysmal movement disorders with UX007 compared to placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: duration of disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events; walking capacity and endurance; patient-reported health-related quality of life assessments of physical function, mobility, upper extremity function, fatigue and pain.

Pam & Kelsey Living with PKU, United States PTC Therapeutics Announces Results from Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Ataluren in Patients Living with Nonsense Mutation Cystic Fibrosis March 2, 2017 PTC Therapeutics Announces Results from Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Ataluren in Patients Living with Nonsense Mutation Cystic Fibrosis 25.2 KB SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J. , March 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT), today announced that the Ataluren Confirmatory Trial (ACT CF) in nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis (nmCF) did not achieve its primary or secondary endpoints. Ataluren was generally well tolerated and ACT CF confirmed a favorable safety profile for ataluren, which has now been used by more than 1,000 patients across multiple indications. PTC plans to discontinue current clinical development of ataluren in cystic fibrosis, close ongoing extension studies and withdraw its application for marketing authorization in cystic fibrosis in Europe . ""We are disappointed with the outcome of this trial as there are no treatments that target the underlying cause of nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis, one of the most difficult forms to treat,"" said Stuart W. Peltz , Ph.D., chief executive officer of PTC Therapeutics . ""We are particularly grateful to patients and investigators who participated in our trials. We remain committed to patients receiving ataluren in other indications."" ACT CF was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trial comparing ataluren to placebo in nmCF patients six years of age or older not receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycosides. The Phase 3 study, conducted in 16 countries, enrolled 279 patients who were randomized to receive either ataluren or placebo. In the intent-to-treat population, the primary endpoint of lung function as measured by absolute change in percent-predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), over 48 weeks from baseline, there was a 0.6% difference in favor of ataluren versus placebo (-1.4% change on ataluren versus -2.0% change on placebo; p=0.534). For the secondary endpoint of rate of pulmonary exacerbations, there was a trend in favor of ataluren, with the rate in the ataluren group being 14% lower than the placebo group (p=0.401). The results were not statistically significant. The safety profile of ataluren in the ACT CF study was consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified. About Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is among the most common life-threatening genetic disorders worldwide. It is caused by defects in a single gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. The CFTR gene encodes the CFTR protein, which is used by the body to transport chloride across cell membranes. Genetic mutations that result in the loss of function of the CFTR protein cause the body to produce abnormally thick and sticky mucus that clogs multiple organs, including the lungs, pancreas and liver. In particular, the absence or very low levels of CFTR leads to progressive loss of lung function, potentially life-threatening lung infections, permanent pancreatic damage and malnutrition because digestive enzymes from the pancreas do not reach the intestines to help break down and absorb food. The average age of death for CF patients is in 
their mid-thirties. About ataluren (Translarna™) Ataluren (brand name: Translarna ™ ), discovered and developed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc. , is a protein restoration therapy designed to enable the formation of a functioning protein in patients with genetic disorders caused by a nonsense mutation. A nonsense mutation is an alteration in the genetic code that prematurely halts the synthesis of an essential protein. The resulting disorder is determined by which protein cannot be expressed in its entirety and is no longer functional, such as dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Ataluren is licensed in the European Economic Area for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. Ataluren is an investigational new drug in the United States . The development of ataluren has been supported by grants from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. (the nonprofit affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation ); Muscular Dystrophy Association ; FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development ; National Center for Research Resources ; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ; and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy.

(Nasdaq: ATRA), a leader in T-cell immunotherapy, leveraging its novel allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) T-cell platform to develop transformative therapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases, today announced primary analysis data from its Phase 2 EMBOLD study of ATA188 in non-active progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). The study did not meet the primary endpoint of confirmed disability improvement (CDI) by expanded disability status scale (EDSS) at 12 months compared to placebo. In addition, fluid and imaging biomarkers did not provide further supportive evidence. ""We are surprised and deeply disappointed with the results of EMBOLD, particularly for the MS patient community which is in urgent need of new treatment options. We are grateful to the patients and investigators who participated in the study, and to colleagues at Atara for their steadfast work,” said Pascal Touchon, President and Chief Executive Officer of Atara. “We are further evaluating the EMBOLD data as we continue to believe in the critical role EBV plays in MS pathogenesis, however we anticipate stopping the study as no treatment benefit was observed.” Preliminary safety data showed there were no new safety signals in the EMBOLD study, reinforcing the favorable safety profile observed with ATA188 to date. Atara is actively reviewing the totality of the data, including a 6 percent disability improvement in the treatment arm compared to 33 percent disability improvement observed in the Phase 1 study, in addition to identifying the factors related to a substantially greater than expected placebo rate of 16 percent for CDI at 12 months compared with an expected rate of 4-6 percent in non-active PMS patients. These evaluations will help Atara determine the next steps for the program. “Looking ahead, we maintain our strong conviction in the potential of our pipeline reinforced by the first ever regulatory approval of an allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy, EBVALLO TM , in Europe,” Dr. Touchon continued. “Following anticipated additional payments and significant double-digit royalties from the recently expanded tab-cel ® partnership with Pierre Fabre, we are currently well positioned with a cash runway well beyond upcoming milestones, including pre-clinical data for ATA3431 at ASH in December, preliminary clinical data from our Phase 1 study of ATA3219 in relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma anticipated in the second half of 2024, and expanding ATA3219 development into autoimmune disease.” Going forward, the Company plans to significantly reduce its expenses on ATA188 and further focus resources on advancing its differentiated allogeneic CAR-T pipeline, in addition to executing the expanded tab-cel partnership with Pierre Fabre through the Biologics License Application (BLA) transfer. These future actions are expected to meaningfully extend our cash runway beyond Q3 of 2025. About EMBOLD EMBOLD is a multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an open-label extension to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ATA188 in participants with non-active progressive multiple sclerosis. The study primary analysis at 12 months included 103 adult participants with progressive multiple sclerosis (non-active PPMS and non-active SPMS). In year one, study participants received two cycles of treatment (ATA188 or placebo) at the recommended part two dose, which was identified in part one, and were followed for 12 months, which is the timepoint for the primary endpoint. In year two, all patients received two cycles of therapy to maintain the blinding – those initially receiving placebo received ATA188 (two cycles) and those initially receiving ATA188 received one cycle of ATA188 followed by one cycle of placebo. After year two, all participants can continue into a three-year open-label extension during which they will receive annual treatment with ATA188. About Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc.

As previously disclosed, safety data from the Company’s ongoing TAMARACK Phase 2 study was submitted in early February to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for presentation at the upcoming Annual Meeting that begins May 31 . The abstract containing this early interim data, based on a January 4, 2024 data cut-off, was not accepted. The submitted abstract is provided below. “While the TAMARACK data will not be presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting, we intend to maintain our previously disclosed plan to share further TAMARACK interim data, including updated safety and preliminary efficacy, by the end of May,” said Scott Koenig , M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. “This updated information will be based upon a future data cut-off. In addition, we still anticipate presenting updated clinical data – including radiographic progression-free survival, or rPFS, the study’s primary endpoint – in the Fall of 2024.” Abstract as submitted on February 6, 2024 : “Title Vobramitamab duocarmazine (vobra duo), a B7-H3 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): Early data from the Phase 2 TAMARACK study. Background Vobra duo (MGC018) is an ADC with a duocarmycin-based DNA-alkylating payload. Vobra duo targets B7-H3, which is highly expressed in multiple tumor types including prostate cancer and has limited expression in normal tissue. Phase 1 testing (NCT03729596) of vobra duo at 3.0 mg/kg Q3W demonstrated anti-tumor activity in mCRPC, although adverse events resulted in high rates of dose modifications and early treatment discontinuation. Lowering the starting dose may improve tolerability, extend treatment duration, and enhance effectiveness. Methods TAMARACK is an ongoing randomized, open-label, Phase 2 dose selection study assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two dose levels of vobra duo (2.0 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg IV Q4W). The study enrolled patients (pts) with mCRPC previously treated with abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide; prior docetaxel was allowed. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed PFS at 6 months. Results At data cutoff ( Jan 4, 2024 ), 182 pts with mCRPC enrolled on TAMARACK, of which 177 received vobra duo. Enrolled pts were 46 to 89 years of age (median 70.5) with ECOG performance status ≤ 2. Thirty (16.5%) had visceral disease at baseline, 109 (59.9%) had RECIST-evaluable disease, and 98 (53.8%) received prior docetaxel. At this early data cut, pts have received a median of 3 (range 1 to 7) cycles of vobra duo; treatment is ongoing in 156 (85.7%). A summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is presented below. Vobra duo 2.0 mg/kg (n=91) Vobra duo 2.7 mg/kg (n=86) Any TEAE 85 (93.4%) 82 (95.3%) TEAE Grade ≥ 3 23 (25.3%) 27 (31.4%) Serious AE 11 (12.1%) 17 (19.8%) Drug Interruption due to AE 10 (11.0%) 16 (18.6%) Drug Discontinuation due to AE 4 (4.4%) 2 (2.3%) Fatal AE 0 0 The most common (≥10%) TEAEs regardless of dose were asthenia (40.7%), nausea (27.7%), fatigue (20.3%), decreased appetite (19.2%), anemia (17.5%), constipation (16.4%), diarrhea (14.7%), headache (13.0%), neutropenia (12.4%), and peripheral edema (10.7%). In the subset (n = 95) of TAMARACK pts on treatment for ≥ 12 weeks or who discontinued study treatment within 12 weeks, TEAEs led to drug interruption in 12 (12.6%) and discontinuation in 5 (5.3%) pts. This compares favorably to the rate of drug interruption (58.5%) and discontinuation (14.6%) observed at 12 weeks in pts with mCRPC who received vobra duo at 3.0 mg/kg Q3W on the Phase 1 study. Following the pre-specified interim analysis for futility on both arms, the IDMC recommended continuing the study as planned without modification. Conclusions Preliminary safety data from TAMARACK suggest that reducing the dose and frequency of vobra duo improves its safety and tolerability in men with mCRPC. The authors anticipate sharing preliminary efficacy data and updated safety data at the conference.

The study did not meet the primary endpoint of change in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score from baseline to week 52 (placebo-corrected mean difference -0.528 points; 95% CI -2.308 to 1.251; p=0.5553). Secondary endpoints measured by change from baseline at week 52 in 4-stair climb velocity, 10-meter walk/run test, time to stand, time to loss of ambulation, and proportion of patients with greater than 10 seconds in the 10-meter walk/run test were also not met. “We are deeply disappointed that the LELANTOS-2 study did not meet its primary endpoint,” said Thane Wettig , Interim Chief Executive Officer, FibroGen . “We are grateful for the courageous efforts of patients, their caregivers, the advocacy community, and the trial investigators who have contributed to this important clinical study. We are committed to sharing all learnings from this trial with the Duchenne community and hope that there are insights that may help future efforts to develop treatments for this devastating disease.” Preliminary safety data showed that pamrevlumab was generally safe and well tolerated. The majority of treatment emergent adverse events were mild or moderate. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were observed in 8.3% of patients in the pamrevlumab group and 2.8% of patients in the placebo group. FibroGen is in the process of evaluating the totality of the data, including other pre-specified endpoints, to determine the next steps for the program. The Company plans to communicate the full results of the LELANTOS-2 study at an upcoming medical forum. About LELANTOS-2 A total of 73 boys with ambulatory DMD ages 6 to <12 years were enrolled in LELANTOS-2, a global, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial of pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with systemic corticosteroids. The primary endpoint of the study was ambulatory function measured by change in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score from baseline to Week 52. Secondary endpoints assessed from baseline to Week 52 included changes in 4-stair climb velocity, 10-meter walk/run test, time to stand, time to loss of ambulation, and proportion of patients with greater than 10 seconds in the 10-meter walk/run test. In LELANTOS-2, patients were dosed with pamrevlumab (35 mg/kg IV on Day 1 and every two weeks thereafter with last dose at Week 52) or placebo. About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare and debilitating neuromuscular disease that affects approximately 1 in every 5,000 newborn boys. About 20,000 children are diagnosed with DMD globally each year. The fatal disease is caused by a genetic mutation leading to the absence or defect of dystrophin, a protein necessary for normal muscle function. The absence of dystrophin results in muscle weakness, muscle loss, fibrosis, and inflammation. Patients with DMD are often wheelchair-bound before the age of 12, and their progressive muscle weakness may lead to serious medical problems relating to respiratory and cardiac muscle. About Pamrevlumab Pamrevlumab is a potential first-in-class antibody being developed by FibroGen to inhibit the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a common factor in fibrotic and proliferative disorders characterized by persistent and excessive scarring that can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Pamrevlumab is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC), and in Phase 2/3 for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer.

(Nasdaq: SNDX) today announced receipt of the final results of E2112, the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), that evaluated the investigational compound entinostat, Syndax's class I HDAC inhibitor, plus exemestane in patients with advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+, HER2-) breast cancer who have progressed on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. The trial did not achieve the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit over hormone therapy alone. ""We're disappointed that the combination of entinostat and exemestane did not demonstrate a survival benefit in this historically difficult-to-treat patient population,"" said Briggs W. Morrison , M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Syndax. ""On behalf of the entire Syndax team, we extend our sincerest gratitude to all the patients, their families and the investigators who participated in this important trial, as well as our colleagues at ECOG-ACRIN and the NCI. Based on these results, we will not be filing a New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for metastatic breast cancer."" Dr. Morrison added, ""We remain focused on advancing our broader portfolio, including our targeted therapy, SNDX-5613, an inhibitor of the Menin-MLL interaction, and axatilimab, our anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. Later this year, we expect to present additional clinical data from the AUGMENT-101 trial of SNDX-5613 in adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias. Based on preclinical data reported to date, as well as recent Phase 1 results representing the first clinical evidence that inhibition of the Menin-MLL1 interaction can induce response in patients with genetically-defined acute leukemias, we believe SNDX-5613 has the potential to offer patients with both NPM1 mutant acute myeloid leukemia and MLL-r acute leukemias a much-needed, effective therapeutic option. We also anticipate the presentation of additional results from our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of axatilimab in patients with chronic graft versus host disease in the fourth quarter of this year."" The E2112 trial was designed and conducted independently by ECOG-ACRIN under the sponsorship of the NCI, which is part of the National Institutes of Health . The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized a total of 608 patients with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer to receive exemestane in combination with entinostat or placebo.

(NASDAQ: FGEN) today announced topline results from two late-stage trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in patients with pancreatic cancer and a corporate update. The pamrevlumab experimental arm in PanCAN’s Precision Promise Phase 2/3 adaptive platform trial compared treatment with pamrevlumab combined with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel to gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel alone for treatment in first line (1L) and second line (2L) patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC). The pamrevlumab arm of the study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival as determined by the protocol pre-specified Bayesian statistical analysis. The Phase 3 LAPIS trial compared treatment with pamrevlumab combined with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX to placebo combined with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX for the treatment of locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. “We are deeply disappointed that the pamrevlumab arm in the Precision Promise trial and the LAPIS trial did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival,” said Thane Wettig , Chief Executive Officer, FibroGen . “We were hopeful that pamrevlumab could bring meaningful innovation to pancreatic cancer patients in desperate need of new therapies. FibroGen would like to thank the patients, their families and the clinical trial investigators and teams for their dedication to participating in these studies. I would also like to express my deepest gratitude to our FibroGen colleagues who have dedicated so much of their time and energy for the prospect of bringing much needed therapies to some of the most challenging and deadly diseases affecting humanity.” Based upon the results of the late-stage pamrevlumab trials in pancreatic cancer, the Company plans to implement an immediate and significant cost reduction plan in the U.S. The pamrevlumab development program will be terminated and the Company plans to expeditiously wind down any remaining pamrevlumab obligations. As a result of the cost reduction plan, headcount in the U.S. will be reduced by approximately 75%. FibroGen’s collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca for roxadustat in China, where roxadustat is the market leader by brand value share in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) anemia category, as well as FibroGen’s collaboration agreement with Astellas for roxadustat in the E.U., Japan , and other territories, remain in place. PanCAN’s Precision Promise Pamrevlumab Arm Efficacy Results Given both 1L and 2L pamrevlumab treatment groups graduated into Stage 2 of PanCAN’s Precision Promise study, the hazard ratio for the primary overall survival (OS) analysis assumed a common hazard ratio to estimate a single treatment effect for both 1L and 2L pamrevlumab patients combined compared to patients treated with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel. In addition, the pre-specified Bayesian model utilized a hierarchical model that included the borrowing of data from the mFOLFIRINOX control arm to the gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel control arm for the primary efficacy analysis. The pre-specified primary efficacy analysis was performed in a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population that included only subjects who initiated treatment. The mITT population in the pamrevlumab arm was comprised of a total of 102 patients in the 1L treatment group and 111 patients in the 2L treatment group and the gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel control arm was comprised of a total of 34 patients in the 1L treatment group and 36 patients in the 2L treatment group. Primary OS Analysis as Determined by Pre-Specified Bayesian Statistical Analysis (mITT Population) Bayesian Model Common Hazard Ratio (HR) Posterior Probability Median Mean (SD) 95% CI Pr(HR < 1) Primary Efficacy Analysis 1.170 1.184 (0.175) (0.882, 1.563) 0.13977 LAPIS Efficacy Results The study did not meet the primary endpoint of overall survival (stratified log-rank p-value=0.55). Median overall survival of 17.3 months was observed in the pamrevlumab combined with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX arm compared to median overall survival of 17.9 months in the control arm of placebo combined with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX (HR: 1.08; 95% CI – 0.83 to 1.41). Pamrevlumab Safety Results (Precision Promise and LAPIS) The preliminary safety analyses across both studies indicate that the safety profile of pamrevlumab combined with gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in pancreatic cancer patients. No clinically meaningful differences in treatment emergent adverse events were seen between the treatment arms. About PanCAN’s Precision Promise PanCAN’s Precision Promise adaptive platform trial ( NCT04229004 ) is a U.S. -based, seamless Phase 2/3 study sponsored by PanCAN that enrolled patients in 24 sites nationwide. The multi-arm study consists of experimental treatment arms and two comparator arms: gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel and mFOLFIRINOX. The pamrevlumab experimental arm enrolled 102 patients with mPDAC in first line (1L) and 111 patients with mPDAC in second line (2L). Both 1L and 2L patients received pamrevlumab in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The final analysis was based upon the data collected up to 12 months after the last patient initiated treatment. About LAPIS The LAPIS study is a global Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment with pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with either gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX in the treatment of participants with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The study enrolled 284 patients, who were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either pamrevlumab or placebo, in combination with either gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX. All patients were dosed up to six cycles of treatment and patients who completed study treatment were evaluated for surgical exploration for possible R0 or R1 resection. Participants who were ineligible for surgical exploration continued to receive treatment as per standard of care (SOC) for each institution.

(“Terns” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TERN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule single-agent and combination therapy candidates to address serious diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity, today reported top-line results from Part 1 of the Company’s Phase 1b AVIATION Trial of TERN-201, a vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) inhibitor in development for the treatment of patients with NASH. Part 1 of the AVIATION Trial met the primary safety endpoint. Compared to placebo, TERN-201 10 mg administered for 12 weeks to presumed NASH patients was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events (AEs) between the 10 mg treatment group and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate. There were no treatment-emergent serious AEs (SAEs), including no cases of treatment-related monoamine oxidase inhibition (e.g., central nervous system toxicity), and no patients discontinued TERN-201 or the study due to any AE. While treatment with TERN-201 10 mg resulted in near complete (>98%) inhibition of plasma VAP-1 in most subjects, there were no meaningful changes in exploratory serum or imaging NASH biomarkers with TERN-201 10 mg relative to placebo, including corrected T1 (cT1), a measure of inflammation and fibrosis linked to clinical outcomes, as well as ALT, AST, GGT and CK-18. Part 2 of the AVIATION Trial assessing 20 mg of TERN-201 remains ongoing, with top-line results expected in the second half of 2022. Terns will continue to analyze results from Part 1 of the AVIATION Trial to evaluate next steps for the TERN-201 program. “We want to thank the patients, study teams and physicians who participated in the well-executed Part 1 of the AVIATION Trial,” said Erin Quirk, M.D., President, Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&D at Terns. “While the AVIATION results from Part 1 were disappointing, Terns is fortunate to have a broad pipeline, cash runway expected to fund operations into 2024 and a stellar team to support our pipeline activities. We look forward to the planned initiation of our Phase 2a trial of TERN-501 alone and in combination with TERN-101 for NASH in the first half of 2022 and our Phase 1 trial of TERN-601, an oral small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist for obesity, in 2023.” About the AVIATION Trial The AVIATION Trial ( NCT04897594 ) is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, proof of concept, adaptive, Phase 1b clinical trial. The primary objective of the AVIATION trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TERN-201 over 12 weeks of treatment in patients with presumed non-cirrhotic NASH. Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetics and assessment of pharmacodynamic effect on VAP-1 activity. The clinical trial is designed to be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 of the AVIATION Trial evaluated 10 mg TERN-201 over 12 weeks with a four-week follow-up period. The patients in Part 1 were randomized to receive placebo (n=10) or 10 mg TERN-201 (n=20), and patients in Part 2 are randomized to receive placebo or 20 mg TERN-201. About TERN-201 TERN-201 is a highly selective, irreversible, covalent inhibitor of vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1). VAP-1 is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in hepatic vascular endothelial cells that binds to proteins on the surface of white blood cells to facilitate their deceleration, binding and transmigration from the blood stream into the liver. VAP-1 has been shown to be over-expressed in the livers of patients with NASH and fibrosis. In Terns’ Phase 1 first-in-human (SAD/MAD) clinical trial across 61 healthy subjects, TERN-201 was shown to be well-tolerated and fully suppress the enzymatic activity of VAP-1 at all evaluated doses with suppression persisting up to seven days after a single dose. In preclinical studies, TERN-201 showed significant dose-dependent reductions in liver inflammation and fibrosis in a model of liver injury. TERN-201 exhibits high selectivity for VAP-1, enhanced liver distribution and minimal potential for off-target inhibition of monoamine oxidases (MAOs). Terns received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for TERN-201 for the treatment of NASH in August 2020. TERN-201 was in-licensed from Eli Lilly and Company in March 2018 pursuant to an exclusive, worldwide license agreement. About Terns Pharmaceuticals Terns Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule single-agent and combination therapy candidates to address serious diseases such as NASH and obesity.

The study did not meet the primary endpoint of a sustained platelet count response in chronic ITP patients. Additional analyses of the dataset are ongoing and the full results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and in a peer-reviewed publication. “This is not the outcome we had hoped for patients, but setbacks are part of pioneering a new class of medicines and these data will provide insights into the broader understanding of FcRn and ITP,” said Luc Truyen, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “We are very grateful to everyone involved in the ADVANCE-SC study, especially the patients and their families, the investigators, and our internal team who worked tirelessly to complete this global study. We remain committed to the ITP patient community who urgently needs additional treatment options to manage this challenging disease, and continue to move forward in our deeper analysis of these results.“ ADVANCE-SC Study Data ADVANCE-SC is the second of two registrational trials conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program for VYVGART and enrolled 207 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pre-treated and 75% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies. Primary endpoint was not met (p=0.5081); 13.7% (17/124) of treated patients demonstrated a sustained platelet count response compared to 16.2% (11/68) of placebo patients Secondary endpoints were not met, including additional endpoints on International Working Group (IWG) responder status and mean platelet count change from baseline VYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated in ADVANCE-SC; the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with ADVANCE-IV and the confirmed safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo Results from the first study in the ITP registrational program, ADVANCE-IV, were reported in May 2022. The study met its primary and key platelet-derived secondary endpoints. ADVANCE-IV formed the basis of the regulatory submission for approval of VYVGART IV for ITP in Japan, where a decision is expected in the first quarter of 2024. VYVGART is currently being evaluated in 13 severe autoimmune diseases, including the registrational ADDRESS study for pemphigus from which topline results are expected around year-end 2023. Conference Call Details argenx will host a conference call today at 2:30 pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADVANCE-SC results. A webcast of the live call and replay may be accessed on the Investors section of the argenx website. Dial-in numbers: Please dial in 15 minutes prior to the live call.

Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x10 9 /L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids, nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs, fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. The study patients who were on 'watch and wait' at baseline were required to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x10 9 /L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later, or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later, were considered non-responders. Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period, proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response, an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24, and the incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events. About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production, which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In rare cases, ITP can lead to severe anemia and life threatening gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhages. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health, including anxiety, fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so a significant unmet need exists for additional treatment options. About VYVGART Hytrulo VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa, a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®, and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It is marketed in Europe as VYVGART and may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.

Pam & Kelsey Living with PKU, United States PTC Therapeutics Announces Topline Results of CardinALS Trial of Utreloxastat in ALS Patients November 26, 2024 PDF Version - Study failed to meet primary and secondary efficacy endpoints - WARREN, N.J. , Nov. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced that the global Phase 2 placebo-controlled CardinALS study did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing disease progression on the composite ALSFRS-R and mortality analysis. While there was modest numerical benefit recorded on the primary endpoint and correlation of favorable clinical effect with lowering of plasma neurofilament light chain ( NfL ), a biomarker of neuronal damage, statistical significance was not achieved (p= 0.52). In addition, significance was not achieved on the secondary efficacy endpoints. ""We wish to thank all of the patients, their families and physicians who participated in the CardinALS trial,"" said Matthew B. Klein , M.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics . ""We are of course disappointed that we were not able to demonstrate treatment efficacy and provide a potential therapy that could address the significant unmet medical need of ALS patients."" Utreloxastat was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in the CardinALS trial. However, due to the lack of efficacy and biomarker signal, further development is not planned at this time.

(Nasdaq:ATRA) today announced results from its Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for PINTA 745 for the treatment of protein energy wasting (PEW) in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, defined as the percent change from baseline in Lean Body Mass (LBM) as measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at week 12 following weekly treatment with PINTA 745. PINTA 745 also did not improve physical function, measures of glycemic control and markers of inflammation. There were no treatment related serious adverse events observed in the trial. “We are very disappointed that PINTA 745 did not meet the primary endpoint of this Phase 2 clinical trial. These data are unambiguous and contrast with prior clinical and preclinical results,” said Isaac Ciechanover, M.D. President and Chief Executive Officer of Atara Bio. “We want to sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this trial.” As a consequence of these results, Atara Bio will suspend further development of PINTA 745. To date, third-party direct costs for the development of PINTA 745 from our inception through the third quarter of 2015 were approximately $10 million. The Company will focus its resources on its portfolio of clinical stage oncology and immunotherapy product candidates, including: Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (EBV-CTL) , which received breakthrough designation in rituximab refractory EBV associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) and is in two ongoing Phase 2 trials for EBV malignancies; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CMV-CTL) , which is in two Phase 2 clinical trials for refractory CMV infections that occur in patients who have received an alloHCT; Wilms' Tumor 1 Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (WT1-CTL) , which is in two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials assessing safety and initial anti-tumor efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies; and STM 434 , an activin inhibitor, which is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial assessing safety and initial anti-tumor efficacy in patients with ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors. Atara ended the third quarter of 2015 with approximately $334.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments, providing sufficient resources to further advance the Company’s oncology and immunotherapy portfolio, including completion of the ongoing clinical studies and the planned initiation of two pivotal trials for EBV-CTL.

Consistent with our previous clinical experience, the vaccine was well tolerated. Phase 3 Resolve™ Trial The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 60 sites in the United States . The primary objective of the Resolve trial was to demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of the trial was to demonstrate efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD). Finally, the trial also evaluated the safety of the unadjuvanted, 135 microgram dose of the RSV F Vaccine compared to placebo. Topline efficacy results of the trial are shown in the following table: Summary of Primary and Secondary Objectives – Vaccine Efficacy Number of Participants - ITT Population (11,856) Primary and Secondary Objectives Placebo (5,935) Vaccine (5,921) Vaccine Efficacy (CI) P-Value Primary:  RSV msLRTD, N(%) 26 (0.44%) 28 (0.47%) -7.9 % (-84, 37) 0.78 Secondary:  RSV ARD, N(%) 117 (1.97%) 102 (1.72%) 12.6 % (-14, 33) 0.32 “We are both surprised and disappointed by the outcome of the Resolve trial, which we recently unblinded. Our initial analyses and review of the key aspects of the trial do not indicate issues with trial execution, data collection, data integrity, or drug product quality. We expect to have preliminary immunogenicity data in the coming weeks to further our understanding of the trial results,” said Gregory Glenn M.D ., President, Research and Development. “Historically, annual seasonal RSV ARD attack rates between 3% and 7% have been observed in older adults1. In our Phase 2 trial, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 4.9% and an RSV msLRTD attack rate of 1.8%. In contrast, we observed an RSV ARD attack rate of 2.0% and an msLRTD attack rate of 0.4% in our Phase 3 trial. These attack rates indicate a mild RSV season in older adults this year. We are continuing to investigate potential root causes that could have impacted the outcome of this trial. We continue to believe that there is a path forward for our RSV vaccine and that there is an important unmet need for an RSV vaccine in older adults.” Phase 2 Rollover Trial Novavax also reported topline results from the Phase 2 rollover clinical trial of its RSV F Vaccine in older adults. The trial was a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled rollover trial which enrolled 1,329 older adults from the prior Phase 2 trial, conducted at the same 10 sites in the United States . The primary objectives of the trial evaluated safety and serum anti-F IgG antibody concentrations in response to immunization with the RSV F Vaccine. The exploratory objectives of the trial evaluated the efficacy of a second annual dose of the RSV F Vaccine in the prevention of RSV ARD and RSV msLRTD. Participants previously randomized to receive 135 microgram RSV F Vaccine or placebo were re-enrolled and re-randomized in the current trial to receive either 135 microgram RSV F Vaccine or placebo. This resulted in analysis of four separate trial arms: a) participants receiving a placebo in both the first trial and second trial; b) participants receiving RSV F Vaccine in the first trial and placebo in the second trial (Vaccine-Placebo); c) participants receiving placebo in the first trial and RSV F Vaccine in the second trial (Placebo-Vaccine); and d) participants receiving RSV F Vaccine in both the first trial and second trial (Vaccine-Vaccine). Topline results of the trial are shown in the following tables: Summary of Geometric Mean Titer for Anti-F by Visit – ITT Population Number of Participants (1,329) Placebo (2014/15) Placebo  (2015/16) (N = 333) Vaccine (2014/15) Placebo (2015/16) (N = 328) Placebo (2014/15) Vaccine (2015/16) (N = 337) Vaccine (2014/15) Vaccine (2015/16) (N = 331) Day 0 (baseline)  N 333 327 336 329 GMEU 1012.8 2293.6 962.9 2267.3 95% CI (922.0,1112.5 ) (2091.8, 2514.9 ) (869.0,1067.0 ) (2076.4, 2475.8 ) Day 28  N 332 325 333 327 GMEU 1019.3 2188.7 6071.2 4489.3 95% CI (928.6, 1119.0 ) (2005.0, 2389.2 ) (5526.9, 6669.0 ) (4137.7, 4870.7 ) GMEU: geometric mean ELISA units Gregory Glenn , M.D., said, “The rollover trial demonstrated immunogenicity in all active vaccine recipients. As shown in the table above, there was a 6-fold increase in anti-F IgG in the Placebo-Vaccine arm, consistent with the Phase 2 efficacy trial. There was higher anti-F IgG at baseline in the Vaccine-Vaccine arm compared to the Placebo-Vaccine arm. Further, the Vaccine-Vaccine arm showed a greater than 2-fold increase in anti-F IgG from the higher baseline. We observed similar low attack rates and absence of efficacy of a single immunization in this trial as was observed in Phase 3 Resolve trial, although we did observe that a second season immunization could provide efficacy. The event rate comparisons made to either placebo groups suggested that the second season immunization was protective, even in a year with a very low attack rate. Further understanding of these data may come forth with full evaluation of the immune responses.” Summary of Exploratory Efficacy Objective+ Number of Participants (1,329) Placebo (2014/15) Placebo  (2015/16) (N = 333) Vaccine (2014/15) Placebo (2015/16) (N = 328) Placebo (2014/15) Vaccine (2015/16) (N = 337) Vaccine (2014/15) Vaccine (2015/16) (N = 331) RSV ARD (%) 8 (2.4%) 7 (2.1%) 11 (3.3%) 2 (0.6%)* RSV ARD Vaccine Efficacy 11 % -36 % 75 % msLRTD (%) 1 (0.3%) 2 (0.6%) 2 (0.6%) 0 *p-value = 0.079; msLRTD was not calculated due to low N value +all data in table is not significant (p-value > 0.05); preliminary N “While the results from the Resolve trial are unexpected, we continue to believe in our technology and product candidates based on the totality of the data from our RSV F Vaccine franchise,” said Stanley C. Erck , President and CEO. “We expect to gain a better understanding of the data from both the Phase 2 rollover and Phase 3 trials as we further analyze and review them internally, as well as with our investigators and potential partners.

Pam & Kelsey Living with PKU, United States PTC Therapeutics Announces Results from MIT-E Clinical Trial of Vatiquinone for the Treatment of Mitochondrial Disease Associated Seizures June 29, 2023 PDF Version SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J. , June 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTCT) announced today that the MIT-E trial of vatiquinone for the treatment of mitochondrial disease associated seizures (MDAS) failed to achieve its primary endpoint of reduction in observable motor seizures. The study showed evidence of treatment effect in reducing seizure frequency in the overall study population and in the largest subgroup of children with Leigh syndrome, in whom benefit was also observed in the key secondary endpoints of occurrence of status epilepticus and disease-related hospitalizations. ""We are incredibly grateful to the patients, their families and our investigators who participated in this important study,"" said Dr. Matthew Klein , Chief Executive Officer of PTC Therapeutics, Inc. ""While we are disappointed with the results of the study, we hope that there are learnings that can benefit the development of other therapies for patients with mitochondrial disease, who remain without approved treatments for this highly morbid and fatal set of diseases."" The MIT-E study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of vatiquinone in pediatric patients with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease and associated refractory seizures. The study enrolled 68 children at study sites worldwide. The study included a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 48-week open-label phase. The primary endpoint was the reduction in observable motor seizures during the 24 weeks placebo-controlled phase. All subjects who completed the placebo-controlled phase were eligible to participate in the open-label phase of the study. While the MIT-E study results do not support the advancement of vatiquinone for the treatment of MDAS, PTC continues to plan to discuss the results of the MOVE-FA trial of vatiquinone for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia with regulatory authorities based on the important signals of clinical benefit on key subscales of the mFARS, such as upright stability.

CytomX is a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company dedicated to destroying cancer differently. By pioneering a novel class of conditionally activated biologics, powered by its Probody ® technology platform, CytomX’s goal is to transcend the limits of current cancer treatments. CytomX’s robust and differentiated pipeline comprises seven therapeutic candidates across multiple treatment modalities including antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”), T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (“TCBs”), and immune modulators such as cytokines and checkpoint inhibitors (“CPIs”). CX-2029 is an investigational conditionally activated antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed toward CD71, which has demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer and is being developed in collaboration with AbbVie. CytomX’s clinical pipeline also includes cancer immunotherapeutic candidates against validated targets such as the CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutics, BMS-986249 and BMS-986288, partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb, as well as CX-904, a conditionally activated T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and the CD3 receptor on T cells, which is partnered with Amgen. In addition, CytomX has a diverse preclinical portfolio of wholly owned assets including CX-801, an interferon alpha-2b Probody cytokine that has broad potential applicability in traditionally immuno-oncology sensitive as well as insensitive (cold) tumors and CX-2051, a conditionally activated ADC directed toward EpCAM, with potential applicability across multiple EpCAM-expressing epithelial cancers. Praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) is an investigational conditionally activated ADC directed toward CD166 that has demonstrated single agent clinical activity in a Phase 2 study for patients with advanced HR+/HER2-non-amplified breast cancer. Following the Phase 2 results, CytomX decided not to further progress praluzatamab ravtansine alone and is seeking a partner to further develop the molecule. CytomX has also established strategic collaborations with multiple leaders in oncology, including AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, Bristol Myers Squibb and Regeneron.
